1ccwkzr,2024-04-25 16:36:49,Going through a midlife crisis,"I have been realizing recently that I am going through a midlife crisis. Three weeks ago, things weren't bad, but it all went to shit after going through a second round of layoffs in one year. I survived it, but started to feel disillusioned. I feel negative about everything.

My partner and I had been looking at homes and discussed living in the state we are at and he told me that he would have everything he wanted. It got me realizing that I didn't have anything I wanted. My entire life I gave up something.

I took care of my family and never had time to make friends, I took care of two ex's while crawling through school. I gave up dreams to travel, to live somewhere new, to study abroad, to work abroad, to work in the field I wanted. I had so little autonomy to myself and I went through life on a team for one.

I am wracked with not knowing what I want. Would it be better to settle in the state and city I grew up in even if I always felt there was something better? Am I just saddened by the place because I have friends, but no friendship circle? Am I feeling the isolation because I work from home? But if I stop working from home then I would have to brave our traffic and I have such bad driving anxiety and our roads are getting worse. Would I experience the spontaneity I so desire if I moved to a more bustling place? Would I even like it? Would it be too cold or too hot? Would I die not knowing how to live in those climates? What if I move and hate it? What about global warming? What if I choose a place affected by global warming? Would my partner even move with me at this point since they are upset with me for how I have been acting? Am I just not finding the right events to go to? Do people my age just not have interest in these types of events? Is everyone just too outdoorsy for me? Should I settle down or should I travel? Will houses get more expensive the more time I am wasting -- they are already expensive now?

If I settle down here, what if laws get worse? What if the elections go poorly? What if I get sick and lose the house and can't afford to cover myself and then think if only I had moved abroad? Would it be a good idea to throw away my safety net?

Should I move abroad? Would moving abroad help? I still have to learn the language. Would I have community or would it be too late? It would be not car-centric, but would that be enough to like it? Would it fit in?

  
The feelings won't go away. For awhile, I was able to tell myself I was happy with what I had because I had gone through worse. Now, that my job is remote and I could travel (never been outside the US and only been outside of my state once in the last sixteen years and barely to other cities), I feel like I could travel, but I am locked down by my partner and my own fears. At this point, with how back and forth I have been, I will probably lose my partner and then have to face all of this alone.",47,25,0.9,millenials,5,Thursday,Afternoon
1cbwkmb,2024-04-24 12:12:05,It's funny how get a degree in anything has turned into why'd you get that stupid degree,"Had an interesting thought this morning. Obviously today we hear a lot of talk about why'd you get a degree in African Feminism of the 2000s or basket weaving or even a liberal arts degree. 

The irony is for older millenials especially but probably most millenials the advice, even more so than advice the warning was if you don't go to college you'll dig ditches or be a hobo. You could say you didn't know what you wanted to do or you don't think you're cut out for college and you'd be told it doesn't matter what you go for, you just need that piece of paper, it will open doors.

Today for sure but even probably a decade ago we had parents, teachers, mainstream media and just society as a whole saying things like whyd you go for a worthless degree, why didn't you look at future earning potential for that degree and this is generally coming from the same people who said just get that piece of paper, doesn't matter what its in.

I don't have college aged kids or kids coming of age so I dont know what the general sentiment is today but it seems millenials were the first generation who the ""just get a degree"" advice didn't work out for, the world has changed, worked for gen x, gen z not so much so millenials were kind of blindsided. Anyone going to college today however let alone in the past 5 or 10 years has seen their older siblings, neighbors maybe even parents spend 4 years of their life and tens of thousands of dollars with half of htem not even doing jobs that require degrees, another half that dropped out or didn't finish. It seems people are at the very least smartening up and not thinking college is just an automatic thing everyone should do.",2026,4972,0.86,millenials,17,Wednesday,Afternoon
1ccjb7c,2024-04-25 04:44:28,Does anyone else's parents get angry when you mention acknowledging your kid's fears and discomforts?,"For example, I have been separated from my son's mom for about 4 years, and currently live with my parents. My son is 6 and has been sleeping over at my house once or twice a week for a couple years now (the separation was hard on my kid so I agreed to have him sleep in one household until he got older). 

A few weeks ago, I decided it was time for him to start sleeping in his own room. I lay with him until he fell asleep, then went to my room and all was fine. Tonight, however, he told me that he just couldn't fall asleep after about half an hour and really wanted to just go to his mom's house to sleep. I double checked with him, suggested a couple things to help him relax, but in the end, that's what he wanted. So I called up his mom and she came and got him and we told him we were proud of him for letting me know his feelings. I hugged him goodnight and sent him on his way.

My parents flipped their shit. ""Why did you let him go back to his mom's, I don't understand, why didn't you just tell him to stop talking and go to sleep"" etc etc.

I found out from his mom later that he'd slipped a bit off the bed the last time he slept over and didn't feel as comfortable as he had sleeping with me in my big bed. So I went online and got a side rail to prevent that from happening. 

Cue my parents ""it's a bed, what's wrong with him? I slept in a bed the exact same size when I was 2 and was completely fine, he needs to learn to just not fall off when he's asleep, this is ridiculous""

Like... what? My kid is a little child, I don't expect him to need a side rail when he's 18 and leaves for college... but he is 6 and isn't comfortable even after my reassurance and talking, so it's my job to make him comfortable... he's not going to never sleep over again, it's literally 1 night. By me listening to him and giving him some control, I'm actually helping him trust me more and feel more comfortable and safe. 

But my parents just get so angry and defensive! They truly believe that they were perfect parents and anything I do differently is a direct, personal attack on them. It's really annoying...",29,73,0.97,millenials,15,Thursday,Night

I mean, do any of you feel like for your entire life, nothing has mattered, nobody has really cared about you, and that 100% of the time the blame falls on you, whether you were involved in something or not?  
  
This is the case with me. I'm in the middle of millennials, I suppose. I'm \~35yo, no college degree, no real experience outside of a very niche industry which I can't compete in anymore, and no end in sight. My mother has saved me, financially, after being laid off numerous times in the past few years. That said, it's still difficult because she is not shy at all about letting me know how much of a financial burden I've been, and I don't discount that, but it certainly isn't helping me get on my feet. If anything, it's leading me further down the hole of ""Well great... not only have I messed up my own life, but I am messing up my mother's life as well..."" and makes me feel more worthless, less deserving of life, less deserving of love, etc knowing that I don't know what to do.  
  
I have a psychiatrist and therapist, both of whom I've been seeing for years now. They really don't help. I live in a red state in a smaller town, and so options are not plentiful, nor are second opinions. I have been diagnosed with panic disorder w/agoraphobia and that means basically ""here take xanax.."". Of course I am on regular anti-depressants as well, but it does nothing. All medical professionals tell me the same exact line: ""medication will not fix your situation"". Well... obviously.. so why am I here? I can't fix my situation, so I tried to get help coping with it. That doesn't work apparently, and the root of all mental illness according to them is situations.

Anyway, I did not mean for this to turn into a post about depressive disorders, but more I want to know: Do any of you feel like, for your entire life, you have been doomed in some way? People not believing you, people assuming the worst about you constantly, people looking to crucify you for your shortcomings, but not offering any guidance to fix them, etc.. Like you are a nobody because of your generation. Invisible except to an accountant somewhere that sees you as an AGI vs Expenditure statement.

Fastforward 10 years and its the 2019-2020 school year, i lost all and any inspiration i had to be a teacher so i started looking around for other work and it was hard getting anything that paid decently with 10 years of education on my resume. A relative referred me to a job he used to work at for our local government, i got in and really ended up enjoying the work, and with the amount of optional OT i am given, (lately i am working 6 days a week) I almost doubled my salary. The thing is when i decided I wanted to leave the education sector. I sought out a career counselor and thru my two sessions with her, she felt nursing would be a sector i can excel at based on what information she gathered about me. So i went for it, I took about a years worth of pre-requistes, stayed up late studying and doing homework. Then I  Applied for the program. Got accepted and placed on a wait list. Waited two years and finally got notice i am to start in the fall of 2024. I would essentially have to quit my current job to go to school. I am 35, im on pace to make 120k at my civics job. I don’t want to let this job go because i really enjoy it and the pay is not bad at all. But i also feel that i don’t want to let all that work I did to get accepted and go into a nursing program go to waste. What would you guys do?

1cbsto1,2024-04-24 08:10:29,Feeling depressed after having kids,"Spouse and I are in late 30s and are first gen immigrants. We have three beautiful kids, good tech jobs, good savings, home in a vhcol with low mortgage. We also have citizenship. Unfortunately we don’t have family here and friends circle keeps changing because people keep moving in and out of our VHCOL area and there is no stability in social life. It feels like its only us here and everything else is superficial and no one would care if anything happened to any of us. We are just not happy. Parents and inlaws are in India and pressure us to move back or atleast tell our future plans.

We were sure we want to be here because kids love it here and things were good. But the recent waves of tech layoffs has us worried. In this country, no job equals lots of issues (no healthcare, lot of expenses that can’t be stopped). So we planned to move back home but it is very very depressing to go back. Spouse hates it there and wants us to fight and stay and doesn’t think its a big deal not to have anyone as a close circle. They would love to have the circle but are not bothered much if it is not there. They feel almost everyone in US that moves away from family lives like this and our situation is not unique. They are open to moving anywhere in US but wants to move to India only as a last option.

I want to make sure my kids and spouse are taken care of in case anything happens to me. Not worried about finances but very worried about social support. Very depressed thinking of my kids. I don’t know what to do and with layoff talk, its harder to justify being here if there is no job to hold us here. What should I do? Stay here and keep looking for jobs? Move back home, spend more time with parents and inlaws, have more people around who will help us if we are in a bind and deal with spouse probably hating the life there? Or should we move to somewhere else inside US and reset our lives there?

I can't help but look back and almost feel a sense of betrayal, but that seems almost too harsh of a way to describe it. The social and economic damage that my parents generation did absolutely derailed us from what I have gathered. I don't blame them, but at the same time I just can't believe a whole generation would be so careless to live as though there would never be a reason to worry about tomorrow. 

The general impression I got was as children, so many of my friends were sold this promise that it would be even better for us than it was for our parents, our parents who had it so well growing up when they did, and because of all that they did in their time it would be even better for us. It was almost as though we were told to dream bigger than anyone else- only for everything to fall apart in front of us before we truly understood what happened.

1cba62d,2024-04-23 17:15:47,I regret going to college & this is why.,"Story time. 

Please be kind :) 

I did okay my freshmen year in high school, but I nearly flunked out my sophomore year. Somehow my mom could tell I needed a change of pace so she enrolled me into an early college program with only 100 students with a smaller teacher-student ratio. An early college high school program means that you can take community college courses (not AP) for free alongside your high school courses. I started doing better in my classes, but I thrived in my college courses. Since I was doing well at the community college, I decided to stay home after graduation and continue my enrollment. I could decide if I wanted to transfer to a 4 year college later. I also planned to take a semester off because I was burned out, and honestly depressed. 

Anyway, I used to go to church and I had older millennial youth pastors as my mentors (I was 19 and they were only in their upper 20s). They started asking all the seniors what our plans were for college. Anyone who said ""gap year"" or ""no college"" was lectured. I told them: ""I'm going to take a semester off before continuing at community college."" My mentor starts aggressively pushing a 4 year college and no breaks. ""You have to go to a 4 year college. And most people who take a gap year never go back. You have to go to college."" Looking back, they were clearly parroting exactly what their boomer parents always told them. 

Never mind, I didn't have the good enough grades for college yet nor the money. My parents were not forcing me to go to college right away and my single mom hadn't saved a penny for me to go, therefore I had to take out student loans for all 4 years. I also had no plan for what I would do with my degree (Journalism, then I switched to Political Science to graduate on time) and naively expected that all manner of entry level jobs would be available since that's what we were told. I had no business going to uni (due to my grades, mental health, and lack of a plan to pay my loans back). 

I did eventually find a college that accepted my GPA, got my grades up, then transferred to a nicer school. But because I didn't take any time off, I actually ended up super depressed and burned out when I finally graduated. I unintentionally took a break from working (in food service) because I moved cities with my partner at the time. While job hunting, I started to discover that I'm naturally good at freelancing in creative work, which doesn't require a 4 year degree. 

I will always wonder what would have happened if: 1. I took the time off I needed to think about what degree (or path) that was worthwhile. 2. I went to community college so I wouldn't have had to take out higher student loans. It still irks the heck out of me that these mentors (while well-intended) misguided me so much. I'm not a victim and I know hindsight is 20/20. But not ""everyone"" needed to go to college back then. **I'm not anti-college at all, I just wasn't ready.** I even went back to school 7 years later in a field I'm actually good at and I had a much better experience. 

**TL;DR: I regret going to college because I was given misguided advice that I had to go by people who were not even my parents. I feel like I made a solid ""adult"" plan based on my income and GPA but it wasn't good enough for my mentors. Taking their advice somewhat set me back because if I had to do it all over again, I would have went to community college, got a job while staying at home, and started my own business ages ago. I would have saved thousands.** ",23,23,0.78,millenials,9,Tuesday,Evening

1cai9rn,2024-04-22 18:29:41,Reasons Gen Z'ers Don't Drink?,"As a millenial drinking culture was big in high school and college but surprisingly for Gen Z it isn't. This is talked about a lot and generally agreed to be a healthy choice and a positive thing and I think it is ie less DUI's, drinking isn't necessarily horrible for you in moderation but probably isn't the healthiest of activities. In some ways the lack of the community and socializing that comes with drinking could probably even be seen as a negative.

I see this mentioned a lot but never really see reasons given, I was thinking about this while driving today and came up with 3 reasons why Gen Z doesn't drink...

Phone Cameras
Back when I was in HS and college there were no cameras on phones. Worst case scenario you had to worry about someone taking a blurry throwaway camera pic of you. There were plenty of mornings I woke up with a traffic cone in bed with me, missing a shoe and aside from wondering oh man did I do something stupid anything would be pretty quickly forgotten. Today with cellphone cameras and even more so social media one bad decision lives forever. I do wonder if young people are wise/mature enough to realize this but it could be a reason.

Cancel Culture
Today people really need to walk on tiptoes, say one bad thing whether you misspeak, said in jest or maybe even say something nasty while drunk but in todays world saying one wrong thing can lose you friends and get you cancelled. I think in all areas of life we tread much more carefully in regards to what we say, this could also be a reason.

Less Connection
The last reason I think is probably the one most people assume is the case which is just that younger people are less social, people today report having less friends than people of a similar age in the past, people report being lonelier, less people are involved in sports teams and organized activities and more people just play video games at home, even those with friends often engage with them on xbox live or social media.

1ccbkrg,2024-04-24 22:26:22,About to go get a cashier check for 20% down for my fourth house in Cash closing tomorrow. Under 30. First Gen Immigrant. Came here without knowing any English. 29 years old. Life maybe hard but just keep grinding. Context in the post.,"Came here when I was 16 as an International Student by myself without any family, without speaking any English. Taught myself English through reading Mangas and attending free ESL classes at night in community college and working 2 jobs while in highschool 

I have 2.0 GPA when I graduate cause school never for me. Went to Community school with FAFSA and save up whatever money I have from working and going to community college to buy a fixer upper at 19 for $50k in the ghetto in cash and fix it up myself over a period of 14 months.

Use my FHA 3% down to buy a duplex and house back for 2 years and rent the other unit out while I go and live in my truck for the next 2 years while finishing my degree. Graduated in 2018 with Bachelor in Business and made connections with the frat bros to have them have their daddy hook me up with a job at the local investment firm 

Leverage the duplex and my SFH to get a refinance loan during the low rates COVID years and locked in 2.25% rate for my third SFH house. Renting out to section 8 right now. Duplex's and the SFH in the ghetto are fully paid off and had tripled in values, this third one I have 50% equity in

Made VP partner in 2022 after 4 years of working 80-100 hours a week 50 weeks year round and now I'm chilling barely work 10 hours a week while getting 6 figures salary and a bunch of wayyy smarter people work for me. I am content and will ride this out coastFIRE style till I'm 65. 

Tomorrow I am going to the bank to buy a cashier check for 20% down on my fourth rental house and I plan to get my fifth house by 33 hopefully when rate go down.

I posted this to say that yes, life is unfair and not anyone can grind to the top but if me a first Gen immigrant with zero English can get to where I am y'all can too. You got this. Not everything is doom and gloom.

Life in America is easy mode tbh I'd never get a chance to climb this high if I didn't leave my third world shit hole of a country

1cb6szs,2024-04-23 15:00:27,Millennial Movie Maker,"This is either going to make a lot of sense to post in here or no sense at all. Does anyone remember when we were young making and editing videos was really simple with Windows Movie Maker? 

Windows movie maker was built in video editing software that was very simple to use. It was a matter of dragging and dropping pictures or video files and cutting and editing them to a timeline. This feature came with computers, came with transitions and effects, came with sound effects, and if you had a microphone the ability to dub over top as well as add music you ripped from CD’s (or downloaded from lime wire).

I’ve bought three laptops in the last ten years and not one of them comes with editing software that comes even close to the simplicity of Windows Movie Maker, has near the amount of features as Windows Movie Maker, and is completely free like Windows Movie Maker. 

I have numerous videos with my family saved in my phone taking up so much space that I decided I would try downloading a movie making app so as to offload some of my storage and put my family trips on YouTube like I used to do when I was a kid. 

Every app for video editing (at least as far as I’ve seen) is not free. It’s not even available for purchase. It’s available via subscription, and if you don’t want to pay a subscription, you get the “free” version that includes no features and huge ugly watermarks. 

I was at work and I finally felt like a boomer talking about this problem with younger staff because they wanted to help me “problem solve” by showing me how I could start paying a subscription and adapting to a very clunky and complicated interface. That’s not the issue. The very app should be free and should be extremely easy to use. 

There was a time in life where video editing was extremely simple, included as a feature of the hardware you purchased, and it didn’t take hours of your life to figure out. When I was a kid I made so many movies, vlogs, and comedy sketches with my friends and it was really simple with a no bullshit interface. 

I can’t tell if I’m old or if they’re over complicating apps so as to make them seem “professional” so consumers can justify to themselves paying for something that should be free. When my sister would make video blogs for MySpace or my brother would make skateboard videos to CKY I’d always help and it would be free and easy.

So they stay home even if their family life isn’t the best. Its still a luxury i do not have.

1c9sg2j,2024-04-21 20:54:58,How are you feeling about self-driving cars & automation? ,"Last year in Phoenix I had the privilege of hailing a ride with Waymo from their app. It is a self-driving taxi cab company. It picked me up from my hotel and I rode in the passenger seat for 20 minutes from to a restaurant for dinner. Seeing the car drive itself on public roads was wild. The only time I had a  surprise was when the car took a right hand turn at a red light. I was not expecting it, but it was legal and there was no oncoming traffic.

I wondered what I was feeling was experienced by our parents and grandparents? The first time they saw a color televisions, or turned on a computer, or perhaps flew across an ocean to visit a different country.

Has anyone else been able to experience hailing a self-driving car yet? How did it make you feel, or how do you think you'll react when you get the chance?

Do you think we Millennials will stop driving ourselves around someday? Do you like driving?

Is your job or anyone else you know threatened by cars and trucks being able to drive themselves? What are you going to do when the day arrives that you're automated out of the job?

Apparently Waymo and Cruise will have self-driving cars on the road in SF, LA, Phoenix and Austin by the end of the year.

1c8nbgc,2024-04-20 11:04:46,"If capitalism truly is the ""end of history"", then I am completely ok with the idea that humanity will die to climate change","
When I was 11 or 12 during the housing crisis, I lived with my disabled mom in a tent in Ocala National Forest for 6 months terrified that id get eaten by bears. This core memory would stimulate my lifelong interest in finding the nuances in the answer to the question ""if I live in the richest country in the world, why did me and my mom have to live in the woods?""

Earlier today I was watching something where the main character is 17. Idrk how to explain it but something about what I was watching made me realize that my current 29 year old self would have nothing but warnings for my 17 year old self. if I were to talk to them, I'd have absolutely no genuine hope to offer. My entire 20s has just been struggle after struggle and I've never had any time at all to just breathe. No semblance of hope for my financial security at all. My borderline personality disorder makes getting through even the 4 day work week I've limited myself to completely miserable. Most of the time I don't even want to be around or observed by people let alone serving the public in a way that only enriches the business owner I work for. 

It has never felt worth it to me. There isn't even a philosophical carrot for me to chase. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live to serve the rich either. The only reason I even care about money is for necessities. I've never had a single thought along the lines ""I think I'd like to work a bit harder and maybe put in some overtime so I can afford x thing"". Working to enrich someone else is so miserable to me that every single possible second I can afford to spend not doing it, I'm going to. There ain't a damn luxury thing money can buy to me that's worth more to me than freedom away from work. Even if there was I couldn't afford it anyway.

I know this is going to sound like I'm some contrarian edgelord, but it gives me these intrusive thoughts that the only option I could live with is fighting and dying in a revolution. I'm not here to make any political debates one way or another, but from a personal mental health standpoint and my own core personality-forming experiences, I don't think I can keep living with myself in an environment that rewards sociopathic behavior in a competition for artificially scarce resources. 

I'm tired boss. I'm so drained from all of the financial hardship and losses in my life that I don't even want to play anymore. I don't really care about anything anymore except my disdain for American culture and Capitalism. I used to be a curious, engaged, friendly, open minded person with all kinds of non political interests, and now all I have left is hate. I don't want to be this way. 

Meanwhile society is still just as polite as ever to the socioeconomic class of people who generate their huge amounts of wealth simply by owning things at the expense of those who don't own things. If I ever met a billionaire in person I'd probably spit on them. It is not humanly possible for a single person to work enough to earn 1 billion $. That fortune should have never belonged to them, it should belong to the workers who actually created the value. Just because they followed the law doesn't abdicate them of guilt and immorality. I wish more people would shame them.

I read an article the other day that said 44% of all US workers make less than 20k$ a year. That article is here: https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/12/03/42166145/what-60-minutes-missed-44-of-us-workers-earn-18000-per-year 

Not only are we struggling so hard, the media won't even admit it.


I guess to wrap up ill circle back around to the title. I'm not saying climate change is something we should ignore, I'm just saying for me personally I don't even have the capacity to care as long as my socioeconomic heirarchy of needs aren't being addressed. I might feel differently if I had a kid, but a main reason I don't want kids is because I don't want them to suffer through this shit like I've had to. The sooner the world ends the less people will have to suffer for the greed of the few. Also reminding whoever reads this that I'm not here to make any political debates and won't respond to any trolling.

1c9ucte,2024-04-21 22:13:37,Struggling... Feeling like I'm stuck,"I feel like I'm behind my peers. And I feel like it's from a life long lack of self confidence and lack of motivation.
I was a gifted student in school. Very shy, a few close friends that I still am close to today. Raised Southern Baptist, very involved in church. Didn't have my first boyfriend until 18yo. Didn't ever work a job (basically because I was scared of people and failure) aside from being our Children's pastors intern my senior year and babysitting.

Graduated high school, went to a University where I declared an elementary education major. Then changed it to undeclared because basically I was scared of being observed teaching. I really don't like any attention on myself, it makes me super self conscious.

So I floated around majors for a while, toyed with the idea of going home and going to a community college. But I was raised super sheltered and had a taste of being on my own, and couldn't fathom going back. Plus I had actually met a group of friends, and I had never really had a solid group of friends up until that point.
Science and math seemed too hard so I declared Criminal Justice as my major. Just wanted to pick something so I could stay at the school and not go home.

Really have always enjoyed Spanish, took several classes in high school and took 3 upper level Spanish in college, but didn't make it my major because I was scared to study abroad.. Also didn't know what I would do with that major besides teach, which I thought I didn't want to do.

I met my husband my junior year of college. We were in the same friend group. He was and is the best thing that ever happened to me. But I was still  so sheltered and naiive and I just knew he would take care of me and I wouldn't have to support myself so it made it even easier for me to shy away from doing anything on my own.

We got married a few months after I graduated, and we moved to Kansas. He had an uncle there who offrred him a job, and I was able to find one in a courthouse as a deputy court clerk. 

We planned to stay there for about 4 years, then have kids. But I'm awful about taking medication correctly (bc) and we found out that we were expecting our first daughter 7 months after we got married. About 5 months after moving to KS.

I was so worried about being so far from my mother and having a baby. He was willing to stay and do it on our own, but I pretty much forced us to come home. We found him a job in the town my parents live in, and we moved back 9 months after moving out there.
Our oldest daughter was born. And we struggled because I couldn't really work very much. We accumulated debt fast. It was stressful. 
Eventually, I worked at a non-profit domestic violence shelter as a legal advocate. I loved that job and I was pretty good at it.

Then, when our oldest was 6mo old, we found out we were expecting #2... It was just a lot.

We lived with my parents for a while. That was a struggle. I began to realize what a co-dependent relationship I had with them.. Mainly my mom.
We had our second daughter, moved into our own home that we purchased. Money was still so tight. Still accumulating debt. Credit cards.. Ect. Looking back now I really purchased stupid shit, usually thinking we needed it or that it would make life easier.. But interest was eating us alive. I had quit my job at the non-profit because my mom couldn't keep my girls 5 days a week all day.

I worked as a substitute teacher, about 3 days a week. My mom kept my girls.

We had always wanted to move back to where my husband was from, close to where we went to college. When our youngest daughter was about 1.5yo he was offered a job that would allow us to move back, so we did.

We didn't have anyone to watch the girls though in our new town, so I couldn't work. Childcare is very limited here and expensive.
My husband worked so hard. Long hours. But we still weren't able to shake our debt. And it had grown even more by this point.
Did that for a few years.

We have a nice house, it's small but it's all we need, an acre and a half, plenty of space for the girls to play. We have a nice truck and my car isn't as nice but it is paid off. We just have a lot of debt, I've been able to negotiate lower interest rates in a lot of it, so that's good. But we have a home equity line of credit with $49 on it... 
Now our daughters are both in school. I was faced with finally having the opportunity to say ""What do I want to do?"" There aren't any court jobs. I just ended up substitute teaching again because it gives me a flexible schedule to be able to be with my girls. I was offered a parapro position at their school, and I took it. I only make $13/hr. And the benefits stink to be honest. I love my job and the kids but I know I'm capable of more..

My parents recently moved close to us, and my in laws live next door now.

They've asked me about teaching. I have a bachelors degree, just not in education. So id have to get my masters, or go through the county for licensure. I just am back to those feelings of fear and inadequacy. Being scared that I'd fail. Scared of having to deal with parents. There's so much that is on teachers these days. 
Also relevant is that I was diagnosed ADHD a few years ago. It gave me so many answers to struggles I've always had. I'm so forgetful, it's like my memory is 30 seconds sometimes. I lose things constantly. I get very overwhelmed when there's a lot going on. I binge eat sugar, I guess it's a dopamine seeking thing. I'm not on any adhd meds. I tried an antidepressant that helped for a few months then seemed to not help anymore. I can't afford therapy of any kind really.

I already feel like I'm drowning between being a wife, mom, and working my current job, and keeping up with my house. But we're in such debt. We can pay our bills, but we can't save. And we can't pay anything off. We'd have so much extra money if we didn't have debt. I'm just so tired. I don't know what to do. If you've read this far you're an angel, seriously. Tell me what you think, give it to me straight..

[https://youtu.be/zUF3qbAD-Qw?si=6O9vFLGCb6xeERLa](https://youtu.be/zUF3qbAD-Qw?si=6O9vFLGCb6xeERLa)

Back then, we were encouraged to embrace humor, even when it was at our own expense. We understood that a joke, even a sharp one, was just that—a joke. However, the climate has shifted significantly. What was once seen as light-hearted teasing is now often perceived as a personal attack, a manifestation of toxic behavior. This raises a poignant question: does our current sensitivity contribute to the deteriorating mental health among our youth?

You see, it seems to me that our generation, and the generations before us, were inculcated with a certain resilience. We were taught to have thick skin, to laugh at ourselves. This wasn't just about being tough; it was a form of freedom. Freedom to express, to air grievances, and ultimately, to understand and forgive. There was a certain grace in how we handled criticism and conflict.

Now, let's be clear: I believe it is vital to respect and protect each individual's dignity. But in our quest for a more respectful society, have we swung too far to one side? Have we, in our effort to avoid causing offense, limited our ability to communicate honestly? This culture of shame and intolerance for differing viewpoints does not facilitate understanding. Rather, it fosters a society where people merely tolerate each other, avoiding the true engagement that builds genuine connections.

It's a delicate balance, one that requires us to navigate the fine line between sensitivity and censorship. How do we maintain our authenticity while still respecting the boundaries of others? This is not an easy task. As leaders, as friends, as family members, we must strive to understand and be understood, knowing full well that it is impossible to please everyone. But it is through this challenging discourse that we find progress, not by silencing voices but by enriching the conversation. Let's not shy away from this challenge; let's embrace it and move forward together.",26,0,0.5,millenials,17,Sunday,Afternoon

On Doordash it showed $95. When i walked in to pick up the total was $80. I thought they missed something. But no it was cheaper cause I called. 

I speak Cantonese so I can converse with the restaurant easily. I was speaking with the front of house when I picked up. I apologized for not using online ordering. She told me it’s ok just call in. It’s cheaper. They also don’t make any extra money on door dash. It’s just more expensive to cover door dash fees.

I appreciate door dash because there’s a lot of resteraunts people don’t visit because of language barrier.

I (23) want some insights as to how people managed to be able to afford to ""lie flat"" financially? 

Lying flat is where one rejects the culture of overworking, while doing the absolute bare minimum to survive. 

The reason behind why I asked this question is because I see no future in being forced to work tirelessly for 30+ years and sucking up to the corporate world. 

I would like to ideally work for 10-15 years, while saving and investing to the point that I can afford to  BaristaFIRE (where I can work low-stress jobs or pursue interests for a living). 

My long-term goal is to potentially own a very small townhome/villa in a low COL area in Australia (anywhere), and eventually ""lie flat"", obviously while still working, so I have the freedom to not be forced to continue the corporate rat race for my entire life. I honestly just don't see myself working until past the age of 60 in corporate.

Some of you have mentioned that you don’t have kids or cannot afford them. Kids are not for everyone and they are indeed expensive. This question was geared towards those that either have kids or have already started preparing education expenses in anticipation of having kids.

There’s a number of you that have mentioned “don’t have kids if you can’t afford them” and similar comments. I find this very naive and narrow minded. You assume that anyone who has kids and is struggling automatically started off struggling and randomly decided to throw kids in the mix for shits and giggles. Life happens.

1. When you tip before you get your food your service could be horrible and there’s nothing you can do because you have already tipped. You are no longer rewarding good service.
2. The customer feels obligated to tip more than usually for fear that the staff may mess with the customer’s food if the tip is too low. 

I feel that requiring you tip before your service is complete should be illegal as it makes an optional payment obligatory through coercion.

I know that customer service workers don’t make much and their job is super hard but it’s ridiculous to put this on the customer. Also if I’m the one picking up my food, why am I expected to tip? I was a waitress and bartender for 10 years and  always tip generously but it’s now getting nuts.

One thing that sticks out to me is many people seem to miss community. Someone in a similar post the other day made a comment that really stuck with me, they said that a lot of the community we had as kids was there because adults in our life had made the connections and taken the time and energy to create it for us.

This could be any number of things but a lot of my fondest memories as a kid are hanging out with other neighborhood kids during a block party or while our parents and the neighbors hungout in the driveway having a few beers. I remember my parents would hangout with some of our neighbors and drag us kids along and I'd play with my parents friends kids, maybe one of the older kids would let me play his nintendo, I remember hanging out late watching star search of all things with these kids. I have a lot of good memories like of simple things like that but just remember feeling a sense of community.

Like this person pointed out in the post the other day, these things didn't just come together on their own. Now don't get me wrong I realize were not living in the same world we were as kids. People aren't as trusting of strangers, people aren't as open to meeting new people. I remember my dads employer used to have a company picknic, things like that don't really happen anymore so that community isn't going to be there by default as much as it was in the past but that doesn't mean we can't create it, but yeah it does take time and effort.

Thinking about this I can admit I kind of want this community but at the same time don't want to get out of my comfort zone or don't want to put in the effort to create it and I think that's true of many of us. Anyhow, just wanted to share this point, yeah in todays society you're going to have to work harder to create community, its not as much just built into life as it was in the 80s or 90s but even back then the reason a lot of us had community was because adults around us created it.

What does that mean? I suppose it means you have to make the effort to get to know your neighbors, say hi to people as your passing them on the street walking the dog around the neighborhood, etc. Again, people are less open to these things today I try to make an effort to give a hello to neighbors I pass walking the dog and many people will cross the street as to not have to talk to you or will look at the ground but I think these little things are how we create more of a sense of community",323,558,0.95,millenials,11,Tuesday,Morning

Every year I say to myself that I am going to take PTO during event week, but I never end up doing it. This year’s big event comes up the first week of May and I do not want to attend. What is a good excuse I can use? Getting sick that weekend seems a little bit too obvious. I hate that I even have to lie, but they always seem to hold it against anyone that can’t make it, regardless of their excuse.  ",4,2,1.0,millenials,5,Wednesday,Afternoon

1c5qjmm,2024-04-16 20:33:22, I'm satisfied and it feels good ,"Black male 38 veteran and I am satisfied with my life right now. I was born into a 2 parents house and one older sibling also I had ADD and was medicated like most of us at the time. I was a smart kid but my school didn't had the funding to help me excel at the time but I made the honor roll when I had the right teachers. Met my future wife online in 2004 and that was very weird for the time unlike now lol. I joined the navy right after highschool and was sent to Japan where I met my future wife face to face and spent Xmas together.
She was still a school girl in Japan and I couldn't see her all the time but I took time off to see her when I could.
         I traveled the world from Australia to Thailand and Malaysia. I danced in Tokyo and Yokohama and hung out with Japanese stars and met Michael Jackson, usher, trey Songz and Will Smith. I learned to speak Japanese to a decent level and got married to my wife and had our 1st on my deployment. I leave the navy and decide to spead more time with my family and move back to America and go back to school. Me and my wife have bumps here and there since we married in our early 20's and are just about as different as you can get but we make it.
        I move up through the US government and get a job back to Japan as a civilian so my wife can spend some time with her family but unknown to me and her is she is under heavy depression. We almost called it quits just before COVID but I always listened to what my pops told me before he died "" a man ruled by his emotions is dangerous but a man who understands his and other emotions is a true worth of a man"" so i listen more and we work it out. I move back to America after 5 years and I started looking for a house just like everyone here and it sucks. Before I even get on the plane my older cousin tells me that my grandmother is moving in with her and that semi new house that she lived in is mine. So now I have 1500sq ft  10 year old paid off house with 0.34 arce of land. I make my wife a garden in the back and build a patio and grill. Having a house that's paid off helped me start my savings to hit past 10k and then boom the VA tells me after years of telling me no that I will start getting paid for my disability. My 3 kids are in advance classes and I paid off my cars and my wife college debt.
        I write this sitting in my back yard as a cool breeze flow through the wind and I am happy. Do I think I am lucky? Hell yeah 😂 but my sister is doing better lol her husband $700,000 a year coaching at a D1 school but you would never be able to know and my cousin who passed to house to me is a professor at a LSU so our family is doing good but we don't brag since we still use coupons and look for sales lol. So I just wanted to say uncontempt with life I don't need a big mansion or a nice car I'm happy

I’m 10 years out of college and I’m still 10 years behind.
All the things I thought I’d have by now are still so out of sight.
And it doesn’t sit with me quite right, I’m 32 years into this life. 
I should have more W’s and L’s got so used to hell I don’t even feel the fire when it’s in my face

Settle down and fall in love wonder where Colin ended up

1c5s6hn,2024-04-16 21:39:59,Rant - every option seems like a scam,"This is a rant. If you don't want that energy, I understand. You might want to look elsewhere.

Why does it seem like every option is a scam?

Paying money to a landlord - I'm paying to cover someone else's mortgage, taxes, insurance and am, in reality, left to do most maintenance on the property (regardless of what the law says). And even if I leave that place in the condition that I found it I know I can inevitably look forward to fighting to get my deposit back.

Buying a property - With interest rates and the cost of housing these days, how is it even worth it? A small home in a medium COL city is probably going to cost you around $450k. Say you've somehow managed to save up $50k despite above landlord's best efforts. Using a basic mortgage calculator: you still end up with a $3500/mo payment including taxes and insurance. That doesn't take into account closing costs, recent regulatory changes which will make the buyer responsible for half the sales commission, and any up-front costs to fix the place up. That also doesn't include HOA fees. And then the banks are somehow allowed to front-load your interest. So in the first chunk of your loan you're only putting away a tiny amount of principle. Yet prices continue to go up while a lowering of interest rates is nowhere in sight. Somehow this hasn't led to a major economic collapse.

Inflation - Gas, groceries, healthcare, education, housing, childcare, transit, everything we need to survive keeps increasing in cost faster than our bosses are increasing our wages. You're given a ""raise"" at work that barely covers those increases (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to be happy about it. These prices go up due to mysterious forces like ""supply chain issues"" but once those issues are fixed the prices don't go back down. It doesn't matter how much harder you work, you get less and less for your effort.

Higher education - From expensive textbooks where you must buy a new online copy, to a pervasive shame around anything less than a four-year college, higher education has been made into another way for people to suck you dry. I think higher education is great and necessary. But the way we do it puts people into massive debt with minimal payoff. We take advantage of teenagers who don't know much about finances by telling them they must go to a four year school if they're going to ""amount"" to anything. Oh and if you really want to have a legacy, make sure that's a private four year school. High schoolers waste what little childhood they have left padding their CV with prerequisite classes or extracurriculars and cramming for standardized tests. Meanwhile all these awesome associates and trade programs exist that allow you to quickly learn at low cost and start making money as soon as possible. But they hardly get a mention. In other countries (like those in the EU) post-secondary education is almost free.

Healthcare - $700/mo for a $7000 deductible plan with numerous exemptions. Need I say more?

Civics - Climate change is in full swing, we're in constant conflict (or bankrolling it), our rights and safety net are slowly being stripped away, and even if you vote, write your congressperson, protest, do all the things, it doesn't seem to change one bit. At the very best all we can do is elect someone who might pump the brakes. And even things that seem like they might make a positive impact end up falling to pieces under closer inspection. For instance, the Infrastructure Rebuilding Act spends a lot of money on transitioning our infrastructure to use green energy. Except it also greatly [increases](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ira_provisions_to_boost_oil_gas_production_and_decarbonization.pdf?cb) the amount of oil and gas leases on public land. The recently approved Willow Creek project may [outpace](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/13/alaska-willow-project-approved-oil-gas-biden) all the gains made by the IRA. And then we have the racial justice protests of 2020. There you had a massive nation-wide uprising. But what change did we really see? Biden [gave](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/01/fact-sheet-president-bidens-safer-america-plan-2/) $35B to law enforcement. Very little changed about policing in almost all localities. This after you had massive rights violations of journalists and protesters during that time. It seems like even a popular movement gets nothing done.

It feels like the entire social contract is broken and there's no way out. Like everything constantly becomes more and more of a struggle, and the finger is pointed at us to fix it, but all of it is so beyond our grasp to influence. And we're supposed to put a smile on every day and sweep it under the rug.",20,20,0.72,millenials,8,Tuesday,Night

But I'm also curious about things like virtual reality and augmented reality, and how they'll change the way we experience the world. And what about space exploration?

1c59lv6,2024-04-16 06:53:34,Running out of options for a viable life...,"So, a bit of a pity post. A long one at that. 

**The TLDR is 'I am in a hole, my life is too complicated to steer anymore, and my brain doesn't want to cooperate with any ideas to dig out of it.'**

The longer version, is 37m (British), with a bachelors in sort of STEM (Biology), which I graduated in **2008**. And then a math-based masters (Ag. Economics) which I graduated in **2020**. Yes, I have all the luck.

Clearly I am not neurotypical, with ADHD obvious from a young age, but increasingly hints of other complications (bipolar, schizo, autism, whatever, to add to GAD and depression) that have made holding jobs and staying in one direction long-term all but impossible.  \[Many have disputed this, and say I am neurotypical enough, so I am obviously high functioning at least\].  
\- Since I turned 18 the longest I have stayed in one country, let alone job, has been 3 years. My longest time with a single employer is probably 2 years, mostly I drive myself out of them within 6 months... despite showing promise, it starts to literally hurt my brain to remain in them.

I have been suicidal many times in my life, and have always just taken the 'well, make a radical change then... what do you have to lose?' philosophy, and that has injected novelty at the expense of building career capital. 

Last year it was more acute than normal, getting to the full planning and resourcing stage. I made big changes again. The business plan I wanted to do with a friend got cancelled due to political changes in that country, so I crashlanded in my last possible refuge... teaching TEFL in Asia. Something I pissed away my 20s doing, and spent the last 10 years trying to escape. Also, the last bastion of 'contact someone, show CV, get job, do simple paperwork, become a legal and functional member of said country'... exactly how it doesn't work anymore in OPEC countries (I spent 2 years trying to find work in Europe related to my field of study, no dice. Best described as kafkaesque).

But, one year further, and the complexity is increasing even more. I have restarted my life multiple times, and had to make decisions between which thing to pursue. Slipping down the trousers of time, I successfully avoided going into plumbing in the UK in 2015, or events there in 2017... in favour of this pointless degree.

I am now even older. My focus on academia has given me nothing but a 'fiduciary responsibility to the truth', which in the current age feels like a liability more than anything. Returning to the UK now feels completely untenable for a vast swathe of reasons; partly due to the last sentence, and partly due to the clear economic and political distress it is under.

I still have rights to live and work in a poor EU country, but cannot find work there. I can just sit there and burn through my savings whilst getting internet addicted. Albeit with a dog.

The country I am in now is wonderful, albeit sanitised and overly controlled, but they are very clear that I am only useful as an English teacher/math tutor, and the way they do it here is closer to management than teaching. It is horrendous. I have taught in a dozen countries, and this is by far the worst (as I had been warned 10 years ago, which is why I never came back then), and adding the electronic addiction that all kids have now to an exclusively elementary market... it's not viable even medium term. I have topped up my finances, and feel healthier, but I need to move on.

I have looked into many careers to try and pivot into. With my age and eclectic work history, I really do not look attractive. I would suit risk management, for instance, but gone are the days of just doing a course and getting an entry-level job to work up from.

Add to that the obvious wrecking ball of AI to the job market in the coming years, and almost anything whitecollar is looking risky. If you already have experience in it it might be ok, but starting out fresh now when the job cuts start to come? Seems a good way to piss away another 3 years and end up even worse off. I've done enough of that, thanks.

So now I am mulling over opening up an education business in Thailand, or going self-employed in events in Germany/England. It's clear that I need to be more in charge to have the motivation to make it work, and that both of these avenues would interest me. They will require some capital, which I have been saving, but they are on the surface good ideas that I could execute well.

The issue, of course, is the endless burocracy. All 3 ideas require almost constant fighting with immigration rules, and that would be the key risk of the idea failing. Getting slapped by the invisible mallet. Hell, even doing it in my home country requires paying punitive fees for domestic insurances that make the whole thing untenable.

I'm still trying. Get knocked down 87 times, get up 88. I'm still here. My work ethic is still good. I am a talented generalist, but I am just so. fucking. tired. It's like this Chinese 'lay down' movement. Just surrendering to fate. Enough attempts, thank you. 

I once heard that the root cause of most suicides is life complexity; that at some point, enough mistakes and bad decisions have added up to make continuation either untenable or deeply unpleasant.

But where are the fresh start options of last resort even?

\- Can't run off and join the circus. No more circuses.  
\- Can't run off and join temples/monastery. They are now run as experiences for profit.  
\- Can't run off and join the foreign legion. They are now HIGHLY selective.

It's a whinge/rant/pity post I know, but one I think a lot of people my age/generation can relate to. And maybe it's just the stress that is making my brain so mushy that I can't think my way out of it either, not because I am a mental. 

ps. I have also tried getting medical help for the issues. You'd be amazed how fruitless the multiple painful and expensive attempts have been, especially when what I basically need is to go somewhere with lower life stress/complexity and a healthier community/lifestyle. Chicken and egg...

pps. congratulations for making it to the end of my Ted talk. I appreciate your time.

This has been particularly frustrating around medicine, stigma around psychedelics and marijuana, and their inability to come to grips with their excessive greed. Seriously, no one needs two homes. On the other hand, they must be in a great deal of pain as a second home is a costly therapy.

I have no solutions. I would like to ask the boomers, what are you running from? Are you aware that excessive consumerism is a form of escapism?

I grew up in the middle of state forest land in South Central Pennsylvania. From around the mid 90s until some time in the 2000s, every fall, my home would become completely covered in ladybugs. I lived in a brick home that was partially built and then was finished later by a different company, and there were some flaws in it, aka entry points for bugs. Growing up in the woods already exposed our home to the occasional big spider, giant moth, praying mantis, etc. (at least there's no cockroaches in the woods though!) But when I tell you these Asian Lady Beetles covered my home, I'm not exaggerating. 

There were so many of them that multiple would fly into you when you were outside. You could see them in the air. They would gather literally by the thousands in the corners of the ceilings inside. Random beetles would be crawling around on your pillow or anywhere else. 

My dad was an alcoholic who worked a lot and didn't feel the need to do anything about them. Maybe there's nothing he could have really done anyways; I don't know. But I know vacuuming them up was almost pointless, because they'd be back by the end of the day or the next day.

They would bite you sometimes. It was just a pinch and only hurt for a second but was annoying AF. And when they died, they would stink really bad. You know how stink bugs smell? Well, for whatever reason I can't smell stink bugs at all, but I seem to be the only person who can smell ladybugs. Maybe I was just smelling their rotting carcuses, but I don't think so, because it was usually when I smashed or flicked one across the room that I would smell it most. I think they emit a stench when they're attacked as a defense mechanism or something. Apparently the reason they are red and spotted is to warn predators that they taste bad, so that tracks. 

To top off the trauma, the ladybugs also helped me realize I was a social class below some of my peers.  I was considered pretty, and was a good athlete, so I found myself trying to fit in with the group that we used to lovingly/hatingly call ""the preppy kids"" or ""the preps"", or the popular crowd. I wish I was cool enough to not be so desperate to fit in with them. I really faked it well for a while. They all had parents who were either educated or owned their own businesses. Their parents were probation officers, lawyers, restauranteers, etc. and my small but federally funded town was very cliquey. I was so naive and innocent. I invited my friends over to my house. I didn't have a mom and my alcoholic dad had his own welding business and was gone most of the day. He didn't clean much and never taught me to maintain my living space or even hygiene. I was kinda on my own and had to learn a lot of things the hard way via public humiliation. I cleaned my home to the best of my ability at 12yo and invited my popular preppy friends over. The ladybugs were there. Despite vacuuming them, they congregated in the corners of the ceilings by the end of the night, and the next morning there were thousands of ladybugs carcasses on the floor. 

They acted fine and nice about it at the time, then returned to school the next week telling everyone behind my back about how dirty my house was and how it was infested with bugs everywhere. I was mortified and so embarrassed. Their moms were taking them shopping on the weekends, they were in the ski club at school, getting highlights put in their hair, getting their nails done at the salon, and I should have known better that I didn't fit in with them. At the time it felt impossible to be both a star athlete and not hang out with the jocks and preps. I eventually quit sports and started hanging out with either the ""bad kids"" or the ""stoner kids"", and sometimes those 2 crowds mingled and were one.

But the incident with the ladybugs was one of the first times I realized my parents weren't the classic ""good parents"" and that my upbringing was not... Normal? Was not correct? I hesitate to say ""normal"" because I think in reality my upbringing was more normal than we like to think, but I think you know what I mean. Fuck those ladybugs. 

For those of you brought up in broken homes, or with addicts, or whatever tough crap you had to deal with, what was the first moment you realized that maybe things weren't ok in your home life? I mean, I obviously knew it wasn't right when my mom was at the bar every night or my dad was scream-fighting with his gf and calling her a crazy bitch and whatever other horrible things he would say, but it wasn't until I was able to compare my life to other kids around me that it really started to hit home. Before, I probably thought it was normal and this hard for everyone. I think realizing that other kids had loving, stable homes made it more real and a lot more difficult after that.

I think back in the day culture kind of naturally evolved ie would start on the coasts and make its way to the midwest and like a game of telephone it gets transformed as it moves through different areas and different cultures. Today because of the internet, social media, tiktok something that happens in California or New York is seen in real time by some kid in farmtown Indiana.

I would argue this has created a monoculture wher there's a single internet culture across the country instead of each area having its own character and culture kind of naturally forming and evolving as it moves across the country. 

I think some may conflate interests with culture ie there's a million plus subreddits for different interests but in terms of culture there's essentially one single culture.

If I'm in town, 70-80% of the time I'll have 1-2 social plans, almost always because I initiated it. If I don't initiate anything, I usually end up just doing things with my husband (being 20-30% of the time). 

I'm also very busy traveling and having family visit but I don't feel like I'm often declining invites because of my schedule.

I have 1 break during that time and I made social plans for then already but because I initiated it.

1) for other married people in their mid-30s, how often do you see friends/ have social plans? Do you consistently have social plans every weekend or is it normal to have a weekend with just your partner? 
2) do you have friends that you text with on a regular basis just to chat? I realize I don't... do I need to start developing a chatting relationship with to people to get closer to them?

Then he responded saying thay it was awesome and we had small talk about what we like about the church but then when i mentioned which service I go to on sundays the replying stopped and it just seemed like he went to sleep but when he saw my message in the morning he didn't reply.

1bzt2zr,2024-04-09 14:08:17,This emphasis on “learning a trade” isn’t as smart as everyone thinks it is when it comes to upcoming generations and employment,"Sure, society will always need electricians, plumbers, HVAC installers, pest control, etc etc. Some of those people make pretty solid money too (right now, relatively). But let’s examine some basic facts about why that is the case.


These fields are critically understaffed and have been for some time. This allows plumbers, electricians, mechanics, and what have you to charge pretty hefty premiums for their work. It is unequivocally skilled labor, and not abundantly available in the market if you’re looking to get it done.


There are also not that many derivatives of it. In most trade fields, you have a break down between residential and commercial services, with industrial sometimes being distinct from commercial (not always, depending on what specific trade it is). Being an electrician is basically being an electrician- there’s very little available in the way of specialization or differentiation from person to person. Trades are pretty much exact sciences.


So, let’s envision a society 20 or 30 years down the line where a substantial percentage of these outbound students pursued a trade. Basic economics, as you already know where I’m going with this, the market is saturated. The thing with trades, like plumbing, mechanics, electricians, etc is that while they will always be needed, they are not needed constantly. When there is a significant shortage of labor, it doesn’t matter too much because the existing professionals in the space get a ton of work. But in a saturated market, they don’t. They’ll be competing over smaller areas of service, and increased substitution options will force their prices lower. Lower price and reduced demand = bad for the laborer for any of the less economically inclined readers.


All of this is also ignoring the *major* industry consolidation happening in these trades right now. Private Equity funds are buying up these businesses at a rate you absolutely wouldn’t believe, and many of the trades are consolidating under a few big companies. Ultimately, it will be the same as being an accountant, but with a *much lower barrier to entry.* Skilled labor? Check. Consistent need? Check. Need for training and licensing? Check. Sure you could run your own little practice out of the strip mall (or your van, in the case of the trades) but the big industry players will dominate the market, doing exactly what corporations do to wages in a labor saturated market. 


I’ve just seen this “they need to get into the trades” idea floating around and wanted to say this. It is a great time to be in the trades currently. But if there is a mass generational push towards them, the competitive advantage of the people entering the field will be greatly diminished.",366,301,0.77,millenials,22,Tuesday,Afternoon

I'm struggling just to save enough to pay for their (very medically necessary) braces!

>If a Boomer (born 1945-1964) had kids when they were between the ages of 20-40, their kids were born between 1965-2004, making their children either Gen X, Millennial, or Gen Z.

>  
>In either case, you can expect that the Generation in the middle of the 3 possibilities will be the ""default"" and represent the largest number of cases, as the Generation to either side will tend to be outlier cases - the oldest members of the parent generation having kids early, or the youngest members of the parent generation having kids late.

Also, in case anyone was wondering this subreddit seems to use ""Boomer"" literally for Baby Boomer and they also apply it to a mindset. So, the usage depends on who you're talking to. But, I get it, the problem is all the same: out of touch old people.",207,0,0.36,millenials,13,Wednesday,Evening
1bzfie9,2024-04-09 01:19:07,Anyone else feel like they have to change their whole personality to fit in at work?,"I started a job a little over 7 months ago. The longer I’m there, the more I feel like I have to change my personality to fit what upper management/leadership wants. For reference, it’s a State government organization. Our groups is about 130 people. My job is mid-level. I have a PhD in my field and am about 3 years out of school. 

My team is great and I like my immediate supervisor. I’ve had no problems working with them, or feeling connected with them. Most of my team is early 30s-40s. 

Where I’m struggling a bit is conforming to the rigid hierarchical structure within the workplace that upper management enforces. Management is 50s-60s. You have to ask permission from higher up for every single thing. There is little room for pursuing professional development opportunities.  Additionally, they are so resistant to new ideas or any type of change. A lot of our procedures are archiac. If anyone proposes a new idea (via their supervisor because you can’t speak with management usually) there’s an excuse for why it can’t be considered. 

I am a fairly creative and curious person and also a fan of building community in everything I do. I feel like the culture of this workplace has taken that out of me. I no longer feel like proposing ideas for improving our work because they’ll just be shut down. The power dynamic is making it hard for me to feel like I’m part of a community.

 If I want to stop being disappointed, I’m going to have to adjust the way I approach work and view my position in the workplace. 

I’m realizing that this is  probably not the job for me, so I’m starting to look elsewhere. However, I’m wondering if I’m just being naive and idealistic about finding a good fit. Maybe it’s like his everywhere I have to learn to accept it.

Millennials outnumber Boomers and the difference increases every day. There is no doubt that prior policies have stacked things against the younger generations. More importantly those policies have consolidated wealth and power in a tiny fraction of the population and they use it to grab more every day. It’s time to stop blaming folks based on their age and start making the changes we need. It’s time to lead. It can be done but it takes numbers to beat the consolidated wealth at the top and the monopolies that plague every industry. 

We all need to vote. Support democracy and show its power. Voting rights, collective bargaining, antitrust legislation, campaign financing reform. These strengthen the power of democracy.

1bynek2,2024-04-08 03:06:29,Is it just me or is everything a scam now? ,"edit\* I've got a new one! So I paid \~$300 to ship a suitcase from France to the USA last month via Send My Bag. It arrived at its destination a full month late completely destroyed. Two of the four wheels were busted off, tape I used to secure it was ripped apart, zipper was wide open, my belongings were spilling out. Special stuffed animals, made for my son by my Grandma who is now departed were missing, probably fell out since the zipper was open. 

So I emailed the company. To my surprise, they sent me to some kind of complaints department, asked me to provide photos of the suitcase, details on each item missing plus the suitcase make, model, cost, and measurements. I spent a good hour researching the suitcase that I had bought at TJMaxx just six months before, went back and fourth with the customer complaint department about finding proof of purchasing it, finally a bank account statement showing the charge from six months ago sufficed. I spent another hour describing the stuffed animals in detail. They asked me for $ value for material cost for home-made items, so I priced it all out. 

Then, they concluded that they were not at fault because it says in fine print in their ""tips for shipping"" on their website that ""suitcases should not have wheels"". (Yea I know, what suitcases don't have wheels now a days?) The amount of rage I felt was so immense that I don't even remember the exact words I used to reply to them, but I imagine many explicits were used. 

So here is my gripe - not only did I over pay for this BS service, lose my suitcase, my son's momentos, but I also lost 2-3 hours of my life following up with these dick heads, plus 5 minutes writing this story out for your viewing pleasure! 

Again, the company is Send My Bag. Please help me drag them on the internet!



Can’t leave neglectful childcare because I signed some dumb contract a while back. Called social services, no one cares.

And this list is never ending. I have to stop myself from listing more.

1bzk6if,2024-04-09 05:16:29,I think the internet gave me the perspective to reject my own circumstances and myself,"I think this was only possible in a time when the internet was coming into existence.

I come from a very toxic kind of narcissistic MAGA kind of family, and I've always known since I was a pre-teen that it was fucked up and that I was kind of fucked because the abuse was too covert for me to ever really get outside help until I had to go get therapy for it way after the fact. There is a lot of shame involved in simply knowing that your family is kind of a stain on society and that you carry those psychological wounds on you that make you incompatible with regular children and their good enough family origins.

It's the access to the knowledge that prevents me from simply identifying counter-culturally from my origin because I know that regardless of whether I identify as left or right, liberal or conservative, good or bad, I will still ultimately be just like them wearing different colors unless I can change radically in a deep way that is impossible for a child to understand. In other words, It would have been easier if I could simply identify as the opposite, but the shame from the understanding ran so deep that I felt as though I could not, or did not have the right to, identify as anybody at all.

And it has been really hard. Because people in my life besides them have seemed to encouraged me being this kind of fawning support character for everyone but myself, and the people who reject me from their life seem to understand that I'm dealing with some issues but it seems like I'm never worth the effort of helping even when I'm forthcoming about all of it. In my personal experience (and a long period of intentionally testing the hypothesis with people), the only people who seem to be functioning well in life in their 20s have had their life pretty much set up for them by parents whose love for them was robust enough to extend into the future. Their privilege is an inner voice which is an echo of genuine, robust love that has carried through generations. I don't see many of these people, but they do exist. They have rose colored glasses, and some of them even understand their privilege, but have no way of helping the others.

But yeah, that's my experience.

My parents got a divorce when I was 10.

I have never had a father figure in my life.

I used to live with my mother who was dating few guys from time to time. They were always alcoholics. There were often some disgusting situations because of that (partying, screaming, etc.)

Then alcoholic grandma moved in with us.

Then, mother had a child with one guy. This guy left. We were all living together: me, my mother, sister and grandma. There's a 15 age gap between me and sister.

So there were 4 of us in a 2 room apartment. Me in 1 room and 3 of them in second room. This is a 35 square meter apartment (375 square feet).

Then mother met another alcoholic and he moved in with us. So 5 people in this small house. They were constantly drinking, screaming, etc.. They were inviting people over. It always used to end with some kind of catastrophe. My sister was with all of them in one room.

I couldn't take it anymore, couldn't live like this. I decided to move. My sister took over my old room. She is 15 now.

I've got a lot of physical and mental conditions thorough the years. Because of that, I'm not the same person that I used to be.

I'm sick and tired of playing this ""game"" where you are forced to put so much money into some stranger's pocket just to be able to live. Bills are one thing, but rent... Also I'm not able to constantly hold a job, so renting a studio flat is impossible for me in a long term. Renting only a room and living with strangers under one roof is also not possible. I've tried that a few times already and I had to run away after few days.

1byq276,2024-04-08 05:32:38,Younger generations don't care about community and relationships ,"I know this is obvious and widely known, but recently I have really been feeling the horrible repercussions of this cruel new reality, I feel a sense of loneliness so deep it feels like it runs through my bones, and I can't ignore or suppress it any longer, which I have only done because this particular societal issue often seems completely insurmountable, and it's easier to just not think about it.

I include myself in this of course, I don't pretend to be be the only millennial who hasn't fallen into this trap, of course I have, I am not accusing anyone, I am simply pointing out that if we don't do something about it, it will be detrimental to us.

People of millennial generation and younger don't seem to care about maintaining and nurturing relationships anymore. I am 29, when I talk about this with people around my age, they say ""yeah well that's just our generation isn't it?"" or ""well you know we're all quite busy, life is hard, things are expensive, we work a lot, we have things to do, we have other priorities, we have to focus on our future and personal health etc.""

That's all well and good... But at the same time there is currently a major epidemic of loneliness, isolation and depression. I'm sure there are many factors that contribute towards this, but surely people can put two and two together, don't people realise how important it is to prioritise social relationships just as much as work and health? Don't people realise how detrimental it can be to have very little, or no legitimate social connection? Humans are social creatures, we need other people. What good is working hard on physical health, opening a small business, buying a house, etc going to do if your mental health starts to decline due to the inevitable detrimental effects of social isolation? What's the point of anything if you're completely isolated from the world?

Recently there has been a major trend in caring for mental health, which is obviously great, people are no longer ashamed to admit they see a therapist, people rave about meditation and journaling and working on self-love, all very good things. But social connection is just as important for our mental health as all these other things. But people are ""too busy focusing on themselves to prioritise time with friends"".... Can they not see how much of a contradiction that is? 

Developing close relationships with others, being vulnerable with others, helping others, allowing others to help us, being an active part of our community, contributing to our community, these are all forms of self-love that people don't seem to be aware of, or just ignore. 

Psychologically, helping others and connecting with others greatly increases our self-confidence and our sense of purpose. From a neuroscience perspective, social interaction increases cognitive reserve and decreases physiological stress.. there are strong links between lack of social ties and mortality. 

It is a matter of utmost urgency that we all begin to prioritise our relationships and connection with our community as much as we prioritise work and physical/ mental health. 

We have become far too used to this as being the new norm, we use the excuse ""this is just the way things are now"", which is never a good enough excuse in my opinion. We should never accept something that is outright destroying our society by using the excuse ""this is just the way things are now""..... How many times have people tried to use that excuse in the past? To justify horrible circumstances? 

I shudder to think what the world would be like now if society had always, in history, succumbed to ""the way things are"" and never aimed for better.

1bxhmi0,2024-04-06 17:50:53,Anyone else know families where it's the kids who turned into MAGA cultists and no longer have a relationship with a liberal parent?,"I ask this because my older brother and his new wife are MAGA cultists, and my mom is a Democrat, and they recently had a falling out. My brothers new wife has had it out for my mom and my niece, just a beeatch to both of them and turning my brother against them. I'm pretty sure she dislikes my mom because she is a Democrat and dislikes my niece because she is half Mexican. My brother actually kicked my niece out of his house (she is over 18), and my mom went off on him and told my niece she can live with her and my stepdad, and then told my brother to get his mobile home the hell off her land. He told her he would never speak to her again as long as he lives. It's been weeks, he still hasn't apologized to his daughter or my mom. He is seriously looking for his own land to move his trailer to. I guess he's just not gonna have a relationship with my mom or his daughter anymore and go through all that trouble and expense. 

My brother was born in '77. Guy was brought up in a diehard Democrat house, but was always completely apolitical himself. But he also wasn't always the brightest person, and he was always more of a macho meathead type than me, and he always showed signs of really strong homophobia. I guess I shouldn't be so shocked. MAGA preyed on undereducated apolitical people who had underlying reactionary tendencies.

She’s the most caring person I know. We only get to talk a few times a month because we both work a lot, but when we do it’s always a great conversation. 

I’m pretty introverted by nature. I don’t like to open up and share when I’m struggling because I don’t want to bother other people with my problems. I have a lot of pride and independence and don’t like to rely on other people. This has actually caused some strain in my marriage, but I’m going to counseling to help deal with some of that. About a month ago I was put on a performance improvement plan at work. Basically if I don’t show improvement I’m going to be fired. I was already severely depressed and this sent me into a spiral. Everyday I felt like I was walking under water and could barely speak. I have a family that depends on me and the pressure to better myself is overwhelming. 

My wife told my mom that I was struggling because she couldn’t get through to me. Mom called me and just let me talk. She encouraged me and told me that everything would work out. And, if things got too hard to call her regardless of what time it was because she is always there for me. 

Today I got a card in the mail (she’s old school like that). Here’s what it said:

“My sweet boy,

Words can never express how very proud of you I feel. You have always been a hard worker, and a great husband and daddy. 
No matter what happens with this job, you will be just fine. A job does not define the person you are, it’s just a job. Everything will work out the way it’s supposed to (those are your grandmothers words). Whatever you need, we will always be here for our boy. I’ll continue prayers. 

All my love,

Mom”

Guys, I’m a 35 year old man with a wife and kids. They think I’m strong like a rock. And I sobbed like a little boy when I read that. She’s truly the best. 

Edit: I guess from the replies I should say that I’m 35. My mom is 65. So yes, being born in 1959, she’s a boomer ",459,1469,0.9,millenials,26,Saturday,Night

I've been very open about my own experiences in therapy including a long-term stay for an eating disorder in my early 20's. They were supportive even though they didn't quite understand, but my mom is still very opposed to therapy and believes she doesn't need it. Whenever I gently suggest she may benefit from speaking to a third-party, she acts as if I slapped her in the face.

My parents are tail-end Boomers, and my mom is a first-generation immigrant (moved here as a young child) so that may have an extra impact on her views of therapy. But mostly, I want her to be able to enjoy her retirement years and not be dealing with emotional stress and the physical symptoms of anxiety.

If we want to change it, we have to do it.

if we start a movement now, a foundation, even with three people that are enthousiastic. then start lobbying. start attracting members, more members, and more members, and start marketing, marketing, marketing. I am very, very, very sure that in 40 years, 45 max, we CAN make a difference. we can in fact change the tides and work towards a more equal and just democratic system in the USA. we can work towards a system that is there for everyone, free from gerrymandering, making polarization redundant because there are way more than 2 parties.

Guess what, we were. Gen X started the ""let your freak flag fly"" culture and we expanded on that. Do you all not remember Hipster culture? Anything and everything could have been cool and trying something weird was not only encouraged but applauded. Remember how Austin and Portland were our Meccas? These weird cities that were proud to be different. We pushed for LGBTQ+ to become mainstream, we pushed for more women in power, we pushed for more diversity in media and power. That was us. 

Bernie was our guy. We said ""fuck this job."" We fought against capitalism by pushing boutique businesses, small craft shops (beer especially), we pushed for self-care over job loyalty. We set the stage for a push to leftism over liberalism. That was us. 

I think Gen Z is mostly doing a great job carrying that torch forward, and this isn't meant to put us over them but I think a lot of us are looking at them with rose-colored glasses. Social media pressure has pushed them into a culture of sameness, of rage bait, and of monetization. Do you think Andrew Tate would have had a platform in millennial culture? Do you think millennials would pay thousands of dollars to attend Alpha Male day camp? Do you think we would stand for the way online dating culture treats women AND men for that matter now? The fact is we have lost a lot of ground in the last 8 years and it isn't only the boomers, there are a scary amount of young people (young men primarily) pushing this trad/breeder stuff and that simply would not have flown with the mustachioed millennials. 

So let's grow out of our self-effacing stage and be proud of how much we moved the culture forward. We had legitimate reason to believe that we had won the culture war before the shock of 2016, and we can and will regain that ground soon. Be proud of what we've done, don't get stuck on how immature we were in highschool because every generation is immature as teenagers. Most importantly, we're not done changing the world. We're just getting started.",251,419,0.85,millenials,13,Wednesday,Afternoon

1bu05bz,2024-04-02 14:29:05,Anyone else's liberal parents addicted to Trump?,"Something that's been driving me up the wall lately. My parents are as democrat and liberal as they come, as am I, and they seem to have an unhealthy obsession with Trump. Almost a full mirror of a conservative who's an overzealous fan. It's something several of my friends have noticed with their parents as well. Whether their parents love or hate him, none of my millenial friends have had a conversation with their parents in years in which he wasn't brought up in some way. It's like an addiction. He's truly the boomer ego in human form. An amalgamation of an entire generation's hubris and narcissism taking its swan song.

We could be talking about something completely irrelevant, and it's almost become a game to me, waiting for the inevitable, ""Did you hear what Trump said yesterday???"". The family group chat has at least one Trump joke every day. For years.

Personally, I keep very up to date on any important updates and am involved in politics, but I determined the man's character for myself 6 years ago. I don't need to know the 50th deranged thing he's said this week.

I don't know how to get them to stop thinking about him all day every day. I agree with their sentiments on him but it's honestly unhealthy for them and for our relationship if they have nothing else current to talk about. I've joked to them about it before and they laugh and go ""I know, I know"". Then 10 minutes later there's a new hot take from facebook they need to share.

&#x200B;

Edit: WOW I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I can't escape the irony now of an errant thought/rant I had about avoiding overindulging in Trump-related news blew up into a 3,000 comment thread about that very subject in the matter of hours.

To respond to a few common/recurring themes here:

* For liberal-minded posters: Just because I have had some feelings of burnout related to the subject when it involves my family doesn't mean I am downplaying the gravity of the situation. The potential re-election of Trump into office is a very real threat with very real and severe consequences.
* For conservative-minded posters: ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" is a useless and dismissive phrase being used to downplay the very real threat and very real consequences of a Trump re-election, and wave off any criticism of a person who is objectively dangerous to this country, and objectively a poor representative of who we should strive to be as Americans and as human beings. Our children deserve better role models.
* I have not mentioned anything in this post about any other politicians or political policies. You are entitled to whatever opinion you want about those. This post is about Trump, a very unique individual in regards to how he acted in and out of the office of President, how the media acts with him, and how he has affected people in our parent's generation.",11628,13220,0.7,millenials,7,Tuesday,Afternoon

1bulviu,2024-04-03 06:41:37,I want a second kid but I just found out my employer will be letting me go.,"I’m 34 and married.  My husband works and has a good job, but I made about $10k more than he did.  His health insurance is really good, too, so as long as he stays employed with the railroad, I’m not worried specifically about insurance.  I am a little about bills and getting a job.

But I’m frustrated that things I want keep getting pushed back because of others.  We already have an 8 month old.  And if I wasn’t 34, I wouldn’t be overly concerned about waiting a year or so.

But my employer basically hired me to make sure another person had a job (hired me to train someone else) and never had any intention of giving me a job for next year.  I’m a teacher FYI.  Ironically, pay is not my issue because I’m paid well comparatively, but the disrespect I personally have faced is mind blowing.  And…I’ve been dicked around in this profession for years.  11 to be exact.  This happened at another district, too, where I was hired and the district had no intention of keeping me beyond my contract probation period.  Both times, they just gave my position to a man.  The people who took my job both times didn’t even interview.  They literally just asked for it. 

So…I’m done with teaching.  I have advanced education.  If you want to know what it is, I have an MBA and a masters in Curriculum and Instruction.  The MBA is new and I haven’t even had it a year and have never worked in business.

I’m fighting an internal battle about having a second kid.  I know job loss is temporary.  It might be for a long time or a short time.  And my parents are pretty well off.  They’d never allow us to lose our house or my car or anything.  I’m very fortunate to have the support I do.  And, if my husband and I have a second kid, we’ll be okay in the long run.

My life imploded May 18th, 2021 when my brother shot himself.  I was the last to see him and I walked away for a brief second.  Heard the gunshot, but didn’t even know that’s what it was.  I walked back in a minute later with the help and there he was.  Just sitting there.  Dead.  32 years old.  And I walked away.  And I shouldn’t have.  But I did,  and since then, I’ve done nothing but make one dumb decision after another, starting with my decision to leave a stable employer because I was having PTSD hallucinations of him in school that I was teaching at and the one we both went to as kids.

I’m just so sad and depressed.  I feel used.  I feel unappreciated.  I feel like I don’t matter.  I feel like I’m letting my child down.  I feel like I’m letting my husband down.  I feel like I’m not doing life right and I’m stupid for even wanting a second kid.  I feel a disappointment. I panic about my kid deciding to do what my brother did.  I haven’t been able to sit in total silence since May 2021.  I can’t sleep without the TV on.  I think he’s here in my house even though he never knew I was buying one because he died only 6 days after we were told our offer was accepted.  My baby’s nursery is the room I planned to give him.  I bought this specific house so he could come here when he was feeling sad and depressed and he never even knew about it.

I don’t even know why I wrote this.  Probably because it’s 2:40am and it makes me feel a little less alone.

My parents prioritized school work and I let them down by being terrible in school. I understand completely the value of playing sports and that's why I am pushing my kids to do sports. You learn team work, get fit, you deal with challenges better, and the overall benefits of exercise on mental health and wellness. You also develop friendships and better memories than I had watching Futurama in my parent's basement.

The issue is that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. My kids are not athletic. They are just below average in terms of performance. That doesn't dissuade me and as long as they enjoy the sport, I'm happy to keep paying for it. I just can't coach them very well and I'm disappointed that I can't do more to keep them engaged in the sport. The better they are, the more likely they are to stick with it.

Just a rant, thanks for listening.

Edit: Some really good feedback which I appreciate but also some people missing the point. We're a VERY active family. We bike together almost daily, we hike on almost any given weekend, we ice skate and ski TOGETHER.

I don’t live in a particularly expensive part of the US.  Bought a house at 22 in 2006 I think.  No down payment.  All those shenanigans at the time.  Atrocious interest rate.  Bank gave me the loan even though I didn’t have solid employment or whatever.  Was just getting started.  But apartment complex lease was coming up and they had bumped the the rent up to like 800 bucks.  Figured fuck it, at that price might as well be paying towards something.

So I bought at the peak of the bubble.  House value got cut in half after it all went wrong (just now finally recovering value)… I just continued to pay down principal.  Triple payments etc when work was going well.  Minimum payments when work was going shitty.  Took about 16 years.  6 years longer than I had hoped.

I think that there is no wrong time to buy.  From my experience.  I have no bills anymore (except utilities, taxes, insurance, etc).  Everything is paid for.  Feel completely free. And I bought at arguably the worst time possible.  What am I missing from this conversation?  Is it not being able to secure a loan that is the problem?

Because of this, there will be a few things that are going to hurt the economy and everyone else as well.

1. They are unable to buy property = property prices are going to fall when there isn't enough demand for it. Remember that Gen Z and Alpha have fewer people than millennials and going forward most countries will have fewer and fewer people unless they get a ton of immigrants from 3rd countries. And yeah I know this is a good thing to a certain point, but it will also effect negatively a large portion of normal people whos money is in the property.
   * Investment companies though will have a field day...
2. Millenials spend less and less money on ""non-essentials"" which means eating out, movies, hobbies, etc. which means less customers for these businesses and will lead to higher prices to keep the businesses at float probably. Again this is purely because they can't afford these extra niceties, so no blame from here.
3. Prices are only going to go up since boomers are getting older and are ready to spend their life savings to have ""fun"" while it lasts. This means millennials will not get much money from their parents once they die or non at all, in most cases. Also, elderly care is very expensive so boomers might even be forced to use the rest of their money just to get by once they get older.
4. Millenials are struggling financially meaning most of them will pass on making children completely or leave it too late meaning they simply can't even have children anymore, thus leading to even larger shortage of future generations.

Combining all of this with the fact that millennials were handed the short stick of the draw financially. Millennials have lived through 3x economic crashes 1990s, 2008, and 2020. Meaning they were most likely born in poverty or their families struggled financially in some form and every time they were supposed to get into the workforce there has been some form of economic crisis pushing them back.

So combining all of this I feel like there will be some consequences for everyone unless millennials are given a break at some point since it's such a huge amount of people who must feel like they have been left behind in everything.

Now, we are leaving dead wasteland of the Internet behind us for Gen-z and Gen-x to cry in. As our gen is entering professional life, it's time for us to devour the world again, with AI","If boomers screwed economy, wy screwed everything else.

We were the generation to experience the Internet in the best possible way and time. We had our cake and ate it to too; we had our early childhood without addictions, without culture wars and outrage content manafactured to click.

We had time to be curious explorers outside, we ran with sticks, imagining we are wizards and heroes, we played and had fun with friends. Our brains developed more or less healthily just in time to eat the cake as it was still fresh - the Internet - after it was already fit for personal use, but before it commercialized and died.

It was literally at the best time possible. Besides the obvious: easy access to infinite knowledge, memes, games, porn, sense of belonging to ***genuine*** niche communities and movements, we were riding the greatest change human civilization experienced, ever. And for a kid, fast disruptive change is a jackpot better than porn.

The sad ruins of the dead Internet we left behind for gen-z and gen-alpha is a terrible dopamine prison overloaded with identity politics. Manafactured outrage powered by all-consuming human loneliness and foreign interests. There is no content, no culture, no novelty, no creativity. It's only dying wasteland. 🎶 There are thousands of the best experts tirelessly working overtime in tall glass buildings, to manafacture content and systems that exploit teens' dopamine systems in the most efficient way. The name of the current competition is: how can we dysregulate gen-z and gen-x's dopamine systems the best?

How cruel must be gods to give us another cake now AI. As we enter our professional life, and have less time for the dead Internet, but we are starting to use AI in its infancy for productivity. Generating images and solving tasks with AI feels a bit like frontier spirit of the Early Internet. Other generations are brainrot from the Internet that gave them no chance to learn, but we are well-equipped to devour remnants of culture using AI tools, and shit out sludge that will cover the world for our children to die in.

I feel it’s imperative for people to gain perspective and actively seek a more well-rounded view of the world. The younger generation, it seems, has become very dogmatic with certain issues and I’m wondering if I’m just seeing glimpses of my former selves in them, should give them grace and room to grow, or if I’m right in not having much faith in their ability to adapt.

I guess a few examples of me changing my mind should be given
- I used to be very anti-law enforcement. Acab, fuck the police, all that. I’d had very awful encounters with police at a young age (arrested for marijuana at 18, was mocked by police, ultimately led to me being kicked out of TAMU). Having had quite a few more interactions with different police officers in my 20’s, even knowing a few personally, I have a completely different view of law enforcement. I know now that they have an incredibly difficult job, can’t be generalized and condemned because of poor representation, and are absolutely necessary for maintaining a healthy society

- I used to be very anti-gun and against the second amendment. I damned firearms as death dealers with only one purpose which was inherently evil. As I’ve gotten older I now have a few and feel much differently. I respect the history of firearms. I’m appreciative of all the food produced with the use of guns and all the protection provided by those who needed them. They’re also super fun and require a great amount of skill and maintenance. That being said, safety and proper knowledge of firearms are imperative when it comes to ownership or use.

- ubi. I used to be **very** supportive of universal basic income. With so much automation and the ever-looming development of ai, I felt it was important that people reap the benefits of such advancements. I felt we should all be cut a check. Then covid happened lol I was laid off because my company sold the property I worked for and received unemployment. For 2 years I was the least motivated to work while getting those checks. Ultimately I became much lazier and absolutely unproductive. Since I started working again, and getting promotions and better job offers that I’ve taken, I feel much more validated and happy going to work doing something I love. I realize that seems anecdotal, but I also work directly with people on welfare. Many are kind, compassionate, and require it, but just as many don’t, and are milking the system without repercussion, and are honestly blights on society.

There’s so much more but I think I’ve spent a little too long on the shitter making this post lol

What are some things y’all have changed your minds on that you thought you never would?

*Ninja edit/update: I wanna make it clear before people take it the wrong way, I am not criticizing Gen Z or the kids I saw. It's cool, and honestly my cohorts were all probably a bunch of douchebags in 2001. Being a douchebag was kinda cool then for some reason. I'm not really making any point with my post, just being an old man yelling at cloud amazed at how different teens are now from when I was one.*  
  
*Another addition: this post probably ~~begs~~ raises the question of what we would have been talking about. (u/sorosmademesaythis pointed out this is an incorrect use of the term begs the question) A little younger it would have been pokemon, hands down. Then N64 games, girls, whatever CD we just bought, football, WWF NWO wrestling, sex (we'd never had it but wished we had), eventually how cool GTA 3 was. Probably always one of those topics.*
  
I'm resting on a couch at the gym after working out. Baylor vs USC women's basketball is on a TV.   
Five teenaged boys, three with the broccoli cut, were watching the game *intensely* and talking about their brackets. I gathered from their talk that they mean women's NCAA brackets. After a while the conversation switched to Chess. The board game.   
  
I am 35 and I forget that I'm not a teenager some times. Like, I know I'm past it, but I feel like I'm adjacent. But only until I am actually around them.

I worry because my brother was completely obsessed with video games growing up and was hardly regulated.  He spent most of his childhood playing and, I believe, it had a lot of negative consequences.

Recently, my son's close friend has gotten in to Minecraft and reportedly now stays home just playing for hours on end.  We no longer meet them at the playground nor do they play sports together.  

I get that interests change but this seems like a downgrade to me.

Do you have rules around video games with your kids?  Is the situation overall not as bad as I perceive it to be?  I'm under the impression that a large percentage of kids are missing from the playground because they are at home on screens instead.

Curious to hear your impressions and if you have set rules around this for your own kids to hear how it's going for you & your family.

1bqwyk7,2024-03-29 18:54:10,"Do you guys think we really have inflation, or do you think it’s Collective Overvaluation that’s creating a Price Fixed Market?","I personally think we may have a little bit of inflation, but what we’ve been seeing since the start of the pandemic is everyone from McDonald’s and Wendy’s to Home Sellers, Landlords with Rentals, and Car Dealerships collectively overvaluing their products, goods, services, Real Estate, and Rentals, and created a price fixed market to wallet drain all their customers.

I think Letetia James uncovered this with the Donald Trump stuff, which he DID really commit a real crime. It’s not victimless, because when you overvalue stuff, you end up creating an inflated market, and there’s a lot of victims, because it’s like a Ponzi Scheme where eventually someone will be left screwed and holding the buck, all the while everyone else made off like Bernie Madeoff, with everyone’s money. 

The issue I personally think is every State Attorney General has been really lazy, and their office staff have not been properly investigating the local markets to see Gas Stations and Grocery Stores screwing everyone by jacking up prices all the time. Believe it or not, they do have laws in place that don’t allow them to just jack their prices up and price gouge everyone. 

And the grossest example of this is Landlords and Homesellers, as well as Used Car Sales. They all collectively colluded to create an overvalued inflated price fixed market, and what they’re all doing is highly illegal, but hasn’t yet seemed to be investigated by local State Attorney Generals, with the exception of Letitia James.

Hopefully it’s a trend that influences other State Attorney Generals and Senators to get off their asses and do their jobs, to bust up Price Fixing, and prosecute Landlords, and Home Sellers who dupe people into overpaying for their lower valued Real Estate.

1bq584i,2024-03-28 20:06:34,'Willful Ignorance' is a 100% valid and morally defensible mental health strategy.,"I've tried all my life to stay ""plugged in"" and support positive change in the world. But a consistent through-line, between 2000 and 2022, was that I slid consistently down into the depths of brutal indifference, depression, even nihilism. There was a clear connect to how ""informed"" I was.

Then, in 2022, I blue-screened and shut it all off - all the news, all the comms apps, and most social media. A remarkable thing happened; my 'world' shrunk to the 4 walls of my house and neighborhood and I found that that world... was *awesome*. Not perfect. But awesome, in its own small way. I've spent the last two years rediscovering gratitude, people I love, and the value of 'small things.'

Bottom line, **do what you can do to effect positive change and then** ***sever the rest***, physically, mentally, emotionally. Yes, it's important to be informed and to push for progress. But the onslaught of this world's constant horrors, through the window of your phone, is not only counterproductive. It'll destroy you.

1bq7d3f,2024-03-28 21:32:18,How old were you when you heard the term millennial?,"I was born in '87, and my entire childhood everybody lumped us in with gen x. Basically if you were an older kid in the 1990s, adults considered you to be a genexer. Gen x didn't have good connotations back then either. The stereotype for a typical genexer was someone who was kind of borderline criminal almost. Rude and disrespectful at best.

I remember there were these PSAs on TV in the mid 90s trying to rebrand generation x, and it featured teenagers dressed in gen x fashion doing gen x things like skateboarding, but without the negative stereotypes of being rude and disrespectful. And they referred to gen x and ""generation excellent.""

I didn't hear the word millennial until I was an adult, and everyone's perception at the time was that it applied to kids in the noughties (2000s or whatever you want to call them lol). I feel like people assumed it applied to the children of genexers. Like if your parents were boomers you were a genexer, and your kids were millennials. Like I realize not everyone has kids at the same age, so like that wouldn't apply to a late boomer who had kids in their 40s, but my parents were mid boomers born in the mid 50s, making them the average age for boomers, and they had me in their late 20s (I'm wanting to say my mom was like 27 and my dad was like 29 at the time).

It feels like the gap between generations is getting compressed by five years with each subsequent generation. Like the boomer period was '45-'65, and gen x was '65-'81; but millennials were '81-'96, gen z was '96-2010, and alpha starts in 2010 and nobody knows when the cutoff date will be.

Could  you please help me with some ideas? I wonder what you guys would enjoy as Millenials? 

As we only have one day, they should be short and cheap, and can definitely be silly.   

Things I thought about already:   

\- Go to our favourite brunch place and order sth he never ordered before  
\- Go to a fortune teller (= I do some silly fortune telling for him)  
\- Change baby diapers (on a doll, as we are expecting our first child at the moment)  
\- Try a milkshake  
\- Play a boardgame in a weird location  
\- Get a tattoo (= washable sticker)  
\- Paint your hair (washable paint)  
\- Try a new form of exercise (karate or similar video from youtube)  
\- Gambling (at home only, we bet against each other)  
\- Visit a park we never went to

1br119s,2024-03-29 22:13:10,"Millennials, I have read some of you lament your own lack of social skills, and blame your parents. At first I rejected this notion, and blamed the individual, but I have experimented with my own baby, and believe I have “tricked him” to be social and bilingual, by making him believe it’s normal.","TL;DR: I understand many millennials will not want to read my long post, and you do not need to read it; I conditioned my baby son to be very social with slow, steady practice.


My son is 3, and my wife and I have “tricked” him into being bilingual already (English and Japanese) and being abnormally social.

At 15 months I started having him say hello to a child’s parent whenever he would play with another child. Later that month I stepped it up to having him say hello to the doorman and employees in stores. By 2 years old I was playing games where he would say hello to 5 strangers on the street each day in NYC.

By now at age 3 I have created a “social monster” who is confident to befriend anyone he sees. We are on vacation, he ran up to these teenagers and is all like “Oi! Oi! Oi! Will you play with me?” After three hours of free babysitting from these kids, I snapped this pic.

YES, maybe those who complain about a lack of social abilities are right; our parents do/should have an obligation to teach us to be social, the same way you teach a child to talk and walk.

What I taught the child about being social:

1. Choose a target and get close; say hello
2. Share something with them; a toy, candy, high five
3. If you’re not friends yet, move onto another child

Other than those basic steps, I let him find his own answers.

** Use caution parents, I’m not sure I recommend this at such a young age. Yes my son has a powerful skill at a young age, but he also gets super lonely staying at home now, so you constantly have to feed his need to make more new friends, and it is not ever enough. He also puts a low value on a single friend, thinking more are easy to get. When a young child is able to “get what he wants from people” socially, it’s hard to stick and iPad in front of him all afternoon.

This matters because a child with no fear of strangers is in danger, and obviously requires constant supervision. My son wants to meet everyone he can, child or adult. Not everyone likes being approached by a random child, but most people do. If you think about it negatively, I am allowing my son to be rude and intrusive, but he has learned to make the experience positive with those he tried to befriend.

 If I could do this experiment again, I would start at an older age, maybe 5 years old. I love that he is social and makes friends easily. On the flip side he is already starting to see friendships as disposable, so there is a “double edged sword” to this phenomenon.

Rant/Nostalgia/looking for advice from others with relatable experiences.","Hey all. A lot of us probably wondered why our parent/s seemingly didn't have friends while they were raising us. Some of us had parents involved in church and would see the same people every week, but we could see even as kids that those weren't the same kinds of friends that we had as kids. We'd never end up like them - we knew how to keep friendships going better than they did of course.

Elementary school, we would get home from school, get on a bike or skateboard, and ride around the neighborhood until we saw another friend or just knock on doors asking if Jimmy could play. These friendships grew, and our friend groups grew, until we were teenagers and getting into shenanigans. Sneaking out to climb on buildings and walk on railroad tracks in the middle of the night, all of us having a crush on the same girl and learning how to deal with that through praise and heartbreak, having inside jokes formed through experiences you had in the same place at the same time, laughing way too hard at Superbad.

And then everyone graduates or drops out. The adult tiers are formed. Everyone moves away from eachother. 

You see who isn't going to make it; friends who can hopefully keep a steady job at walmart and can retire for a bit before they die. Being the weed or booze guy in high school kept them socially afloat.

You see who absolutely made it; friends who got their degree and you know will have a positive impact on the world. Had their weddings at a venue, guest lists exceeding 50 people. You're invited, but don't know anyone, ans you're actually surprised you're not in the wedding. Surprised because it took you too long to get it.

Everyone moves on. This great tree of relationships that you spent years cultivating to be a tightly-knit group, thinking it would last forever,  has its branches growing in every different direction.  Some falling off the tree, and some branches blossoming and growing higher than you can reach.

You may have work colleagues, a PTA meeting, an HOA, a professional relationship with your community, but you'll never have that tree again. No one you ever talk to will ever know the context of your childhood and young adulthood, nor do they need to.

 The tree is still there, but the trunk is hollow, and you can't reach the branches.",14,27,0.86,millenials,28,Thursday,Night

Edit: Notice none of the comments disputed what I posted. The comments responding to my post contact no verifiable facts, no empirical data points, no substantiative counter arguments. Just mindless echo chamber comments.

The point differential boomers voted for was four points for Trump. For the previous generation (Silent Generation) it was a differential of 19 points for Trump. You millennials and Gen Z can't even get your generations straight.

Again, the whining generation that has contributed very little for the betterment of humankind. Only benefiting from what past generations brought forth. Your generation is one that can't accept the fact that older generations are in a better place because it took thirty years of struggling. While you expect to be given things right out the womb.

You are SUPPPOSED to struggle while you are young. On the upside you have something you really don't value right now- youth. It's an amicable tradeoff.

1bp2ylv,2024-03-27 14:16:34,Boomerang Boomers,"There is a now a phenomenon where millennial's parents are moving in with their children's home. Which is surprising that the best off generation is moving with the worst off generation for support.

I bring this up because I am in that boat. My wife and I are homeowners who were lucky enough to buy a house at a reasonable price in 2015. At the time we had a toddler and a newborn. I was, am still working a part time job on top of my full time job to cover daycare cost. My wife works full time as well. Overall we had our hands full. 


My father-in-law had just spent a period of his life unemployed. When his parents died, he inherited a large sum of money and had lived off that money while not working until that money dried up. With that money gone,  at age 65, he decided he needed to rebuild.

 My wife offered our home for him to recover for a year.  It seemed like a sweet deal for both of us. He would recover financially while helping us out. He got a part time job to make money to save money. And would help with 1-2 days a week babysitting. For a while that worked great.

But that one year turned to 5 years. He seems to have no plan to leave. He no longer helps with babysitting. He complains when we make too much noise in our house. And will frequently go on far-right political rants. While my wife and I cannot bring up anything political because it might offend him. 

He has also been known to have a tantrum when I don't offer him food I made for my kids or wife. Or not bring home takeout when I take my kids to a restaurant.

I also feel he is a determent to my childrens up bringing. When I tell my kids, no more screen time, they will just go downstairs where my father in law is and watch cartoons. I ask that they don't. But my father in law ignores my parenting and does what he wants. He also provides them so much candy and sweets that my daughter is getting overweight. 

Anytime we have brought up a plan for him to move out, he changes the subject. Or says he wants to buy a house, which at age 70 with little money saved, seems a little ridiculous. We as a couple feel stuck with him in the house. But we aren't ready to legally evict him. 

Just curious, does anyone else have boomerang parents? Or am I alone in this struggle. ",458,440,0.86,millenials,2,Wednesday,Afternoon

1bqevi6,2024-03-29 03:07:41,Racism in the Small Business Arena,"Today I arrived at my privately leased office and there was a door tag 🏷️ on it preventing me from entering my unit due to late payment. I immediately connected to the WiFi and made the payment, spoke to the receptionist and waited on a resolution. After about five minutes, I asked about the unit. When would I be let back in? I was told to send an email to the community manager. Okay. We had a brief discussion about it, and I sent the email. No profanity. Just a normal conversation. I am a black woman and both of the receptionists present are white women. We are in the southwest US. 

After the email was sent, I went to the receptionist’s office. No one was there, so I looked at her laptop. She sent a teams message to her manager (the person I emailed) and said that I cussed her out. The screen was live, so I typed in “I’m lying. She didn’t cuss at me. I’m just being a cunt and not doing my job.” Into the teams message. Inappropriate? Sure but I thought it was funny. I also took a bag of wristbands from the receptionist’s office to make a petty point. Hold my office hostage, I take something of yours in return. 

I emailed the manager who responded with a wild response about my behavior being unacceptable blah blah blah. At this point, forty minutes have elapsed. No one has come to unlock the door and the manager says she has to wait on the finance department. This is clearly a lie, so I pressed her and told her that she is constructively evicting me by not immediately allowing me back into the unit. She ignored my emails thereafter and…get this…told the receptionist to call the sheriff. Two deputies walked me out of my own job today and I am certain it is race-related. The reason I said this is because two other business owners (also female and black) asked for assistance with her rental agreement during her renewal period to downgrade to a virtual office. They ignored these requests. 

People are often oblivious to the insidious way that race relations don’t just impact individuals and bash black people in the US for not making progress. I come from a fairly well off family and we still have to deal with this nonsense from jealous people in the dwindling white majority. This is why DT is so popular. They know their time is ending if not over, so they are holding on by their fingernails to last vestiges of power they have.

One of my friends was raised by their grandparents since he was 2, birth mom died and father is non-existent, and both grandparents were born in 1942. Unfortunately, one of them passed away a few years ago. My friend is 32.

The other friend was born to a dad who is from 1944 and her mom from 1957. So two different generations. My friend is 28. I will not forget when I called her Dad grandpa when we were in elementary school, I still feel embarrassed.

I only know that my my father was born 1961 (he is the typical boomer cliche) and my mother 1968 (but my mother was not raised in America so I am not sure if she counts). I'll be turning 29 soon.

Looking back on my life, it feels like my life progressed normally up until 2020 when the pandemic hit. That’s when reality seemed to completely unravel, although perhaps 2016 is when things started to become “hyperreal” with the election of Trump and the ensuing news cycle.

I was 32 years old when the pandemic started. I was in a place where I felt like I was about to transition to a new phase of life. My career just started and I was enjoying the night life and social scene of the city I was living, hoping to find someone to settle down with soon.

Then I woke up today. I’m 36 years old now, still luckily in my established and well paid career. But now I’m back home working remotely from my dad’s house, as he lost his job during the pandemic and needed help to keep the house. I remember very little of 2020, and most of 2021. I spent 2022 and 2023 back in the city I grew up in but have been away from for so long that I no longer kept contact which childhood friends. I’ve spent this time doing little outside of being hyper focused on my hobbies and being chronically online.

I get complimented a lot on how young I look for my age. When I talk to someone from Gen Z, I perceive them as being the same age as me but I get taken aback frequently at how vast the age gap between them and myself actually is. I literally feel like a man that has been cryogenically asleep for 5 years. 

Anyone else notice how sudden it seems like us millennials became irrelevant in the wider culture. It seems like yesterday we were the young up and coming generation….but today we are middle aged?

I look in the mirror and see a 28 year old bachelor, but inside I know that I’m 36 and most men my age have kids that are old enough to at least be in kindergarten.

I’m not depressed about it, because I don’t see it as I got left behind or something, but I do find it disorienting. I want to start dating again but I don’t know how I fit in. I went out with a girl a few months ago, 31 single mother of 3, who was shocked and called me an old man when she found out my age. I met another girl recently who I also thought was young, but when we were talking she mentioned she was 35 and has a 15 year old.

Using 1990 as a benchmark, globally:
* Malnourishment dropped from 18.3% to 8.9%.
* General tech advancements. We all talk shit about bad habits caused by the internet and smartphones, but having the world's knowledge at our fingertips is beyond incredible.
* Literacy has increased from 86% to 92%.
* Child mortality has dropped 60%.
* Life expectancy has increased from 64.2 years to 72.8 years.
* Extreme poverty has dropped from 36% to 9% (!!!).

In the US, using 1990 as a benchmark unless otherwise specified:
* The poverty rate has decreased from 15.9% to 10.5%.
* Violent crime has dropped from 758 incidents per 100k to 388. This is even crazier in major cities like NYC, where in raw numbers homicides dropped from ~2500 to ~380.
* Infant mortality has dropped from 10.8 deaths per 1000 to 5.6 deaths per 1000.
* Life expectancy has increased from 74 to 79 years.
* The Soviet Union and the ever-present threat of nuclear war ended.
* Access to clean water increased from 88% to 99.4%.
* Median household income (inflation-adjusted) has increased from $52k in 1980 to $86k in 2019. Caveat that this doesn’t necessarily mean millennial income has also increased the same.
* Median net worth has increased from $94k to $186k (inflation-adjusted).
* A massive increase in diversity.

This isn’t to ignore student loan debt and some of the comparisons between millennials and baby boomers in terms of wealth, but some of that is anomalous (boomers and the US economy benefited from Europe being annihilated in WW2).

1bn62r9,2024-03-25 05:30:04,Getting duped by Boomers when buying Homes,"From my personal experience, I think it’s a really bad idea to buy a home until you’re well past the age of 42, just because the older people involved are predatory, and trying to dupe you, and rip you off every step of the way. Home Sellers, especially Boomer, and Older Gen X Sellers are looking to dupe Millennial buyers and the houses are in most cases misrepresented by the Realtors, Brokers, and Sellers, and they prey on 1st time buyers, and know they’re naive and gullible, because it’s their 1st house, and it takes years to uncover and piece together all the crimes that are committed by these people. 

If you do intend to buy a home, make sure you sue the Seller for any form of duping and misleading they do, such as if they list the house as a 3 bedroom, and the septic is only rated for a 2 bedroom, and the house is listed with the Town as being a 2 Bedroom, sue everyone involved for misrepresentation. When you go to sell, if you sell it as a 3 Bedroom, you’ll end up getting sued yourself. 

It’s a really dirty business. Also Home Inspectors are most of the time crooked and just pass everything, and most of the time, the Realtor knows them, and they work together to sell the house. The Inspector passes everything, and the Realtor recommends him to new clients. That’s how that works. 

I advocate if you’re gonna buy, don’t be afraid to make a relationship with a Real Estate Attorney, and don’t be afraid to file lawsuits against everyone who dupes you. There’s extreme Life altering consequences, that ensue when you overpay for a house, and get duped by Sellers, and Realtors. 

There’s all sorts of stuff I won’t waste time getting into, like the seller has prior knowledge of a development going up that’s gonna end up changing the value of the home, or screw up the drinking water. There’s so many factors. Once you own a home and get screwed, you know what to do and what not to do, and the realtors treat you entirely different. You’re pretty much gonna get screwed buying your first home, especially because a Boomer and older Gen X is selling it to you, and they want ridiculous prices to fund their retirements, and get a nice big jackpot for themselves, off of your backs, and hard labor.

I personally won’t buy until the last boomer is dead. I think the market is gonna crash and everyone buying right now is gonna be screwed like after the 2008 Crash. I seen it happen already, and it always happens when Baby Boomers Sell their houses in droves. They collectively collude and run up the market for top dollar, and then it crashes for the next guy, because the local incomes can’t sustain the prices paid. Avoid buying if you can is my advice.

1blbk20,2024-03-22 22:05:14,Apparently I (30M) have the professional reputation of being a family man/family oriented. Sad that it’s a distinguishing quality instead of the norm. ,"I’m in house counsel at a large corporation. I left private practice when my sons were 1yo because I realized my career as an M&A attorney at a law firm was not compatible with my desire to put family first and be an active and present father. I realized I didn’t want the life the partners had and so I decided to go in house. 

My firm understood and even commended me for making that decision. When I interviewed for my current role I made it clear that family was my priority and apparently the C-level executive of my team appreciated that a lot and it was a big part of me getting the job. 

Recently I’ve had several colleagues bring up in passing that my reputation is that I am family focused and some have shared that others said the same to them about me. My manager shared that that is the reputation I have and said it’s not the norm for men in our industry so it sets me apart. She acknowledged that many employers would not look positivley on that but our company and especially our team very much does. 

A former colleague from my old firm reached out today for advice and a referral to my company, and highlighted the fact that my move in house was to focus on family and expressed approval of that. I’d never spoken to him about my move so I take it this is my reputation at my old firm too. 

It’s wild to me though that the fact that I put my family first is a distinguishing factor. I know lawyers have the reputation of being workaholic absentee dad’s but with our generation I’d hoped this improved.

I just realized there’s this sub too because I’m in the one with another n called r/Millennials

Also, about the description of the sub, if you grew up just before 2020, so 2019, then yeah that’s the last of Millennials if you mean 25 years of age

But 2002 borns who turned 18 in 2020 are for sure Gen Z and a few years younger than the last possible Zillennial year, nvm Millennial

Also, I obviously remember Barack Obama and I’m legit in the core of Gen Z (2004). I literally voted for him in the fake election we had in Pre-K class

But yeah the other stuff makes sense though although you can remember Bush being President without being a Millennial and maybe even being Gen Z

Like if I payed attention to the current President in the end of his term when I was newly 4 years old, then I would actually remember Bush despite being at least 10 years younger than you guys

So even a 2005 born could definitely remember that at 3 years old. That also means a 2013 born could remember the end of Obama despite being late(r) Zalpha leaning Alpha

But yeah obviously I know that it means you easily remember all of those things, not the tail end of one of the extra ones that’s actually a Gen Z thing or a Young Millennial teenage-young adult thing and I’m just overthinking some slight things at the very end of that list

So yeah Ig some of those events in the sub description are probably from the late 1990s and almost everyone born in the first half of the 1990s should remember them, and they just added Bush and Obama just for the sake of it.

So the fed government just authorized a $5.8b student loan forgiveness for 78,000 borrowers.  Which IMO is a drop in the bucket for over $1.7T and 43,000,000 borrowers total.  Previous attempts have faced way too much resistance from Republicans to do anything meaningful about it, and considering all the corruption in politics, a spending bill of that magnitude is simply too hard to pass.

So my thought and I am sure many other have the same.   Why not just eliminate the bankruptcy immunity for student loans?  I think it would be much easier to pass, since that should have been illegal in the first place.  The banks have already made so much money already on student loans this should be tolerated by banks.  Philosophically student loans should be treated like every other loan.  I get the lack of collateral thing, but they just need to bake that into the terms, without a lifetime of debt slavery.

Capitalistic governments have chosen to worship ""Profit"" as the ultimate good, and the corporate appetite for infinite growth has left a very few very rich, and the rest of us struggling. 

None of this is new news. 

With AI, things seem even more scary. If these guys can automate, automation, then where exactly does that leave us?

I submit that the only way to combat this will be to vote with our wallets. The otherside of AI is that people are given the power to utilize it too. Someone who is highly creative, but lacks skills in accounting can now open up a business with AI helping them with their weaknesses. In the same vein, a small team of 5 can now do the work of a much larger workforce, and compete with big players in their industry. 

True, we don't live in a true capitalist system. We live in a state sponsored one, meaning that any time big banks, or fortune 500 companies fail they get bailed out, unlike us. Politicians don't seem interested in helping, votes don't seem to matter all that much, and we can forget about help from the state itself. 

The only way the people can get any semblance of power back is by determining how they will spend their money.

Eventually AI will enable us to create entire films, disrupt entire industries, revolutionize non-profits. AI is truly comparable to the advent of electricity. However just like electricity, it's only as good as what we use it for.

1bjuhen,2024-03-21 01:23:50,I've Managed To Repair My Relationship With Alcohol (Long Rambling Post Ahead),"This is gonna get long and rambling, and if you make it to the end, I really appreciate it.

I’ll start with the background. was born paraplegic and grew up being really sheltered by a verbally, emotionally, and psychologically abusive parent. When I first started drinking at 21, I had an enjoyable, moderate relationship with alcohol. I was able to easily leave alcohol at the table, was focused on the flavor, rarely ever got drunk, and prioritized the other people and experiences in my life. 

When I was 22, I made a mistake. In retrospect, it wasn't that big of a mistake. No one died, no one was injured, nothing illegal happened, I had this one class that I needed to pass not just to graduate, but to even start my major. It was math, I have a math learning disability, and the campus was so wheelchair inaccessible that I was self-tutoring myself for pretty much every class I took. I failed; and not just a little bit. I mean less than 50%. This, I didn't blame myself for. However, I knew that when I went home no one would listen to me when I said I did my best, and I would be blamed. I was terrified, and didn't know what to do. So when I got to my apartment I got drunk, played video games, and ordered pizza. I had *never* done that before, but I was so scared and at the time, didn't have the mental health tools to really with it. 

When the pizza guy got there, he decided that he was uncomfortable with a guy in a wheelchair being drunk, and called 911. When I tried to explain to the EMTs that I was able to handle myself, no one listened and I was dragged out of my apartment to the hospital. 

My dad and my older brother had reactions that I thought were pretty fair. Basically, “Look, we’re not saying that this was a *good* moment for you, and please don't do this again, but people your age do much dumber things every single day in college and are never held accountable. *we* did worse every day, and were never held accountable. You got drunk in your own apartment *once*, and you were dragged to the hospital and humiliated.” at this point though, my mom was the one around most of the time, and for months straight she yelled at me about how much I embarrassed her. Sure enough, she blamed the school thing on me too and told me I was lazy.

From then on, I felt like I had to prove that I could handle my alcohol. Which I tried to do by drinking WAY too much and trying to handle myself. Of course, that's not how body chemistry or biology works. This was followed by a long period of abstinence because I didn't trust myself.

Long story short, at 30 I'm back to that healthy relationship I had at 22. This and my fitness/self-care routine are the two biggest accomplishments I’ve gotten since COVID-19, and I'm really proud of myself. 

Again, if you've made it this far I  really appreciate you.

I tend to fall more in the first camp, but the second camp seems to think that since the world is perfectly fine in their minds, they can't understand why on earth anyone would complain about the current status quo or why we *on average* don't do as well as generations past.  I don't have all the statistics memorized off the top of the dome, but I think there's a misconception amongst this crowd that we're all out here saying our lives are ruined.  I disagree; I think most of us are just acknowledging our reality and trying to make the best of it.  The ""quit complaining"" crowd is so terribly disingenuous and argues in bad faith so often that I really don't believe most of it is legitimate.  I'd be willing to bet that most of these posters:

* Are grossly exaggerating their career successes
* Are grossly exaggerating the level of adversity/challenges they've faced in life
* Are Gen Xers or Boomers posting as if they're millenials
* Don't live in this country

The rest either fall into one of two groups:  Oblivious to the world around them and genuinely believe what they're saying OR they understand the game is rigged, but it works for them, so they have no interest in changing it (i. e. the Tim Scott, Milo Yiannopolous, Nikki Haley types).

If you want to complain about the status quo, complain.  Don't let anyone push back against your experiences, they're most likely just trying to shut you up and push their own agenda.

If you truly think everything is fine and your fellow millenials are just complainers, do what I do when I see a stupid, asinine thread that makes no sense to me:  Don't engage, and scroll past.  It's very simple.

What I’m finding is after years and years of taking my lumps, late nights , sleepless weekends of grueling work to get ahead all of the sudden companies have decided to grow a consciouse and demand better hours for their workers.

That’s great I think except the squeeze is still there and who does it fall on now? Not the lower grunt workers, Gen Z has spoken their mind.

Instead as deadlines approach and demands are made we cannot expect the younger gen to rise to the challenge at the risk of getting blowback. But at the end of the day the quality and the integrity of the final product falls squarely on my shoulders, which essentially leaves me getting stuck with the bill once again on projects. Having to again, work late nights and weekends to make up for the lack of additional help despite the high bar that is demanded to be met.

Companies are desperately trying to maintain optics that they are ethically driven to provide better hours while collectively not actually doing anything to fix the bottom line. They sweep it under the rug.

1bilnwd,2024-03-19 14:31:42,Possible unpopular opinion: I think our collective expectations in life are too high,"Just for context I'm 30F, single, working multiple jobs, and from a lower middle class family. This post isn't meant to be a deep dive into the intricate economic and governmental issues in the United States, just sharing my thoughts and obeservations. Also, this post obviously doesn't apply to everyone, I'm speaking generally. 

Everywhere you turn on the internet, there are complaints about the state of the country. Grocery prices, interest rates, home prices, the cost of school, you name it.

While there are a plethora of things to genuinely complain about, sometimes I feel that millenials and the generations after us have wild expectations about what life should look like. They make a lot of comparisons between us and generations before. Such as our parents/grandparents generations owned homes, took vacations, had 5 kids, and didn't have the struggles we have today.

But it seems that we are failing to realize that life has always been a struggle. Sure, my parents owned a home in their mid-30's but it was an old twin home/duplex that was less than 1,000 sq. ft. for the 4 of us. We had Christmas presents, but we never got Nintendos, Razor scooters, or American Girl dolls like the rich kids did. I've had exactly one invite-your-friends-from-school birthday party in my life (a bowling alley in elementary school), and our vacations consisted of one trip to the beach 45 minutes from my house where we stayed in a rundown motel for 5 days.

The things we currently expect in our daily lives were special treats in the past. Eating takeout or at a restaurant, coffee shop lattes, certain snacks and cereals from the grocery store, and shopping in general. I wore my sister's hand-me-downs or got new clothes from K-Mart layaway once a year before school started. My first car was a 20 year old Ford Escort that I paid someone $800 for with a speedometer that maxed out at about 80mph. When I first moved out on my own I would check my bank balance on my phone while I was waiting in checkout lines to make sure I could afford what I was buying. If I couldn't, I put it back. I didn't charge it to a credit card.

Our grandparents had 5 kids but they lived in a run down home with 3 tiny bedrooms. They'd make big pots of grits or oats to feed their family. They'd eat almost-expired meat by tossing it into a beef stew, or made liver and onions for dinner. Our grandparents bought one set of furniture when they got married and kept it for 50 years. Our parents got married at a VFW with artificial flower bouqets and disposable cameras on the tables.

The moral of the story is: These days we expect to live in 3,000 sq. ft. homes, have new cars, have the latest phone upgrade, always be updating our home decor/furniture, throw our kids Instagram-worthy birthday parties, take family Disneyland trips every year, have all the streaming services, shop at Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, have lavish dream weddings, AND have the disposable income to blow at Target while we sip on our Starbucks.

Listen, I'm over here paying almost $2,000 for a one bedroom apartment right now. I'm single, I'm working multiple jobs, and I don't have a wealthy family to fall back on. I get it - it's hard.

I understand that there is much to complain about, but it's always been that way. People, especially families, have always struggled. It wasn't abnormal for people to work 2-3 jobs and still barely pay the bills. It wasn't abnormal to struggle to afford groceries. These are not new concepts that started with us. Our parents and grandparents couldn't afford the types of luxuries that many people feel entitled to today. Many families of the past were ALSO one emergency away from being broke. Not just us.

Whether it was a war, the Depression, or the 2008 housing crisis - there has ALWAYS been some major factor affecting the general public and the economy. So when I see people talking about what they SHOULD have because ""our parents did"", it gets under my skin a little bit. We want houses but many aren't willing to live in small, old homes that need some TLC like our parents owned. We poo-poo the houses with 90's oak cabniets and formica counters, and complain when things look outdated.

I just feel that we collectively need to take a few history lessons to look back at how people have always lived. I'm not saying we shouldn't strive for improvement, but I also think a lot of people need a reality check. We have access to so many luxuries, resources, and conveniences that our grandparents could only dream of. Yet we are here complaining that those luxuries and conveniences are too expensive. Everyone wants the biggest and best of everything but also say they don't want to work 40 hours a week. Unfortunately that just isn't how it works. That's never been how it works. You sort of have to choose one or the other: luxury or less time working. Unless you come from wealth, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

I just get frustrated with the lack of gratitude I see all the time. Life is hard but I also recognize that it's a privilege to be alive during these times. Even during the pandemic, we still made out significantly better than generations past did during major world crises. Like I said, this won't apply to everyone, but jeez can we all just have a big fat slice of humble pie once in a while?",928,291,0.62,millenials,13,Tuesday,Afternoon

I don't understand why some redditor deep in the dunning kruger Kool-Aid think it's intellectually contradictory or limiting to be religious.   


 The dialogue between science and religion is not about proving one right over the other, but understanding how they illuminate different aspects of the human experience. It's about exploring how leading figures in science have navigated these waters, integrating their faith with their work in ways that propel them to the forefront of discovery and innovation.   


 Why is it then, that discussions often veer towards division rather than exploration of this intersection?

 couple years ago i had a really piss ass terrible time that came out of nowhere. maybe this is just a natural evolution of our lives? the business man who buys the fancy car.... its in every movie, book, tv show... suppose i never really though of it as a 'real; thing.

i lived a pretty isolated life - no dating, minimal friends. as mom had taught - lower profile and just more on my own.  late 20's/early 30s was when i found really true close friends - started rekindling friendships from my school days as well.  always felt i had time to do whatever... i was never emotional, never effected by strife, always stoic and calm.

well i hit late 30's and something clicked. i had no idea what... id met a woman that didn't work out so i thought it was that at first, then other unfulfilled dreams maybe... it threw me into a dark and shit place. total mental breakdown level of chaos in my life that came with inability to sleep and serious physical manifestations.

my life changed a great deal when i stopped holding myself to ideals id learned as a young adult. suppose i reached a fuck it stage... on the back-end of this breakdown i started opening up, exploring life, one might say i started living.  ive spent more time partying, bars, clubs, raves, conventions.. .more gf's, cuddle buddies, close friends in the past year and a half than ive had in my entire life...  i decided to build my life more as i wanted - gaming/movie theater in my living room, tools for projects in the garage. just a path that is far more focused on what i enjoy.

after these experiences and now a solid chunk of time past my struggles i have come to realize it was the isolation that broke me. when i have friends and groups of people - im happy. if i stay inside and just stay to myself i do not feel well.  a very abrupt and total 180 from ive felt at any other time in my life.

maybe an unrealized manifestation at suppressed emotions/desires? who knows. life has a way of surprising us, even after decades lived. ",187,101,0.89,millenials,27,Monday,Afternoon

Like by “middle age” your default status in the eyes of this current society is “pathetic until proven impressive,” and impressiveness usually just means having authority over anyone else at all, even if it’s just a kid you made. That’s pretty fucking weird honestly. Why aren’t we just impressed when someone’s happy and nice.""

The stock market is where the rich have all their money.  literally all of it besides real estate. The stock market is basicly a measure of who is wealthy and who is not.  if you look through the graphs, people of color dont own stock, and theyre all broke.  young people dont own stock, and theyre all broke.  Its all held by old white people, and guess where all the money is?.

 College is a debt trap that keeps you from investing.  Dont get caught, work the hard high paying jobs that everyone else our age complains about and wont touch with a 20 foot pole. 

Heres the forumla to not be like every broke ass millenial.

1. Work hard AF, 2-3 Jobs, hustle anything you can to earn extra.  This is why the first 100k is the hardest because you have to work with your back for it.  Dont be ashamed, take the hard job, work 80-100 hours a week, if you ever want to escape poverty this is the only way.
2. Be cheap, live cheap as u can, and Dump every penny into the market concistently for years.
3. Once you make some decent gains in the market, BUY REAL ESTATE.  but keep money rolling in the market for your next leg up.

you will end up like the old rich white guys.

Within 90 seconds of me starting to talk about these things, she prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro and (?mg) of Ambien.

She asked me basically zero questions. 

I was having trouble sleeping because my sleeping environment was crap, and once I made some major changes, I'm sleeping better. The depression and anxiety was partially because I was exhausted, partially because I had just gotten my ass kicked at a job I didn't enjoy, and partially because of a developing family situation. And after 6 months of tests on my heart, it turns out to be fine, it was just anxiety about my heart (which can be cured by finding out you're fine) 

Now I'm sleeping better, my heart is fine, I don't work at that job anymore though I'm kinda still recovering. They were really despicable. And the family thing has gotten worse but also not as demanding so I can ignore it most days.

It's the reason why facebook, boeing, activision blizzard, and every other large company that was once great, now sucks more and more as time goes on. 

Then, last night, I got home from a trip to tired to make dinner and grabbed McDonalds from nearby. I noticed something about the chicken nuggets (aside from them being $5 more expensive than the last time i bought Mcdicks) ...

They suck. Like, they're not the chicken nuggets they were 6 years ago. They are ""airy"" and mushy. The chicken has no substance or texture. It's like they ground up chicken nuggets, then added 25% filler of some kind, like just maybe flour or cornmeal. 

Has anyone else noticed this?",30,32,0.86,millenials,5,Tuesday,Afternoon

1bc7zxv,2024-03-11 16:55:40,Are things actually that bad for millennials or do we just hear a chronically online vocal minority?,"There was a thread on here earlier making it seem like most millennials are screwed financially, and the ones who are doing fine are only doing well cause their parents have money. In my peer group, that's definitely not true. I know people who didn't come from money and are doing great because they thought outside of the box and figured out how to capitalize on the way society is changing. i know people who did come from wealthy families and are struggling because they squandered the opportunities they did have. And of course people who are doing well because they had a head start and people who would be doing better if they did have a head start.

Ya, life's unfair like that, no argument from me here. We should try to make it better from everyone. But it seems to me like it's a spectrum, kinda like it's always been. I just don't think things are ever so black and white. I really can't help but feel like things aren't actually THAT bad and it's just a biased sample of people we're hearing from.

EDIT: wow, based on the way things have gone in this sub before, I was not expecting the majority of comments would agree with me. Like I said, things aren't fair and I'm completely open minded to anything that makes them a little better for everyone. That said I felt like I was going a little crazy with people online *insiting* things were terrible but when I looked around I saw they weren't that bad. Almost like I was being gaslit by that chronic-online minority into thinking I was completely screwed and I shouldn't even try to make my situation better. Crab bucket mentality, as they say. It's really refreshing to see I'm not the only one who's noticed this and thinks this way.

EDIT 2: This really did blow up, and after reading all of your comments, my conclusion is that it's a little bit of both. Like things are getting worse in some ways (and better in others), but there is a sampling bias towards people who aren't taking responsibility for their own lives. This has got me thinking that this is like ""the boy who cried wolf"" situation, when you complain about everything, people stop paying attention and won't listen to you when you talk about something that is actually a problem. I also have to say that I'm disappointed but not entirely surprised at the immaturity of some of the responders.

Financially, living at home is my only option in my area at the moment. Privacy is at a premium, and of course I want to be as respectful to my family as possible. 

The only experience I have with this was a few years ago, and the relationship wasn’t long (for other reasons), so I don’t feel like I got a good sense of dating while living at home. 

I feel like it’s a turn-off when I say I live at home. Is dating (and everything that comes with it) realistically feasible when one or both people live at home? What sort of toll does it take over time (if it takes one)? How do you feel if someone says they live at home when you’re initially getting to know them?

I lived on my own during college and it was so easy to date knowing that I could easily have someone at my house and not disturb anyone else.

1bbm0sw,2024-03-10 21:43:48,'Criminal for existing’: US’s unhoused still fear sweeps as supreme court to take on shelter case,"A few highlights from [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/01/homeless-supreme-court-case) everyone should read. This effects everyone no matter how well off you currently are.

🔘 ' Next come the police officers, chaperoning other city workers and giving encampment residents an hour to collect their belongings. Whatever they can’t carry or transport goes into the trash compactor.

“You start trying to prioritize what you need,” said Freeway, who has been on the receiving end of too many sweeps to count. “You try to pull yourself together and figure out what’s important. And the entire time you’re doing this, there’s a good chance the police officers are going to harass or antagonize you. ” '

🔘 ' Encampment sweeps like these can destroy a person’s shelter, transportation, vital medicine, important documents and treasured, irreplaceable heirlooms. Bulldozers can crush pets or even neighbors who dont’t get out of their tents in time. They shatter support systems that have been cultivated during the camp’s existence, another round of state dehumanization. '

🔘 ' Rather than spending money on getting people housed, communities spent money on attorneys to figure out how to continue doing the same thing, but in a constitutional way.

Multiple sources said that municipalities have been known to leave one or two shelter beds open – or simply add an extra “bed” in a cramped space like a closet or storage area – for the explicit purpose of allowing cities to continue sweeps.

Other attempts by cities to skirt the new requirements have been more brazen. In 2021, following a lawsuit over ordinance enforcement in Chico, California, when there weren’t enough shelter beds, the city tried to pass off “an asphalt tarmac without a roof, walls, water, or electricity” as adequate shelter. A court eventually rejected this attempt. '

🔘 ' ""There’s this term ‘service-resistant’ that a lot of cities have been using to criminalize folks further.. [snip]..That you’re choosing to be houseless, that you’re no longer unhoused because of systemic circumstances. 

But in reality, the services they’re offering just recycle people through programs, and they get to make a little money off our bodies until we’re returned to the streets, more houseless than we were when we first went in.”

The systems of capitalism cannot resolve the homelessness problem because they directly benefit from poverty. If people were properly fed and housed we would have a different economy and political system. We wouldn't provide half ass homeless shelters that's not an accident. We wouldn't dehumanize and criminalize the working class or the impoverished.

Maybe this is just my bias, but I feel like if you were born after me, it's a stretch to say you largely grew up before cellphones/internet. 

By the time I was around my freshman/sophomore years in high school, it was already to the point where at least one friend you were with likely had a cellphone. To be sure, at this time (around 2002) it was still common to be out somewhere with friends and no one had a phone, but this was phased out pretty quickly. 

Internet culture wasn't quite the same as there was no social media yet. But AIM, message boards, and internet humor were a pretty dominant social force. 

I guess what I'm saying is, it was already kind of a mixed bag for me in this regard and I was already 3 years old by 1990.

1b905iz,2024-03-07 17:23:15,Why Millennials Should Advocate for a Higher Minimum Wage in the United States,"Hey fellow Millennials,

I wanted to spark a discussion about something that affects many of us directly: the minimum wage in the United States. As we all know, the current minimum wage is simply not enough to support a decent standard of living, especially considering the rising costs of housing, healthcare, education, and other essentials.

Here are a few reasons why I believe we should advocate for a higher minimum wage:

1. **Cost of Living**: The cost of living has skyrocketed over the years, but the minimum wage has failed to keep up. In many places, it's nearly impossible to afford rent, groceries, and other basic necessities on the current minimum wage.
2. **Income Inequality**: The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, and a higher minimum wage can help mitigate this problem. By increasing the minimum wage, we can ensure that everyone earns a fair and livable wage, reducing income inequality in the process.
3. **Economic Stimulus**: Contrary to what some may believe, raising the minimum wage can actually stimulate the economy. When low-wage workers earn more, they tend to spend more, boosting demand for goods and services and ultimately benefiting businesses.
4. **Dignity of Work**: Every job deserves to be compensated fairly. No one should have to work multiple jobs or rely on government assistance just to make ends meet. A higher minimum wage would reflect the dignity and value of all types of work.
5. **Health and Well-being**: Financial stress can take a toll on our mental and physical health. By ensuring that all workers earn a living wage, we can improve the overall well-being of individuals and families across the country.

Of course, there are counterarguments to consider, such as concerns about potential job loss or increased prices for goods and services. However, numerous studies have shown that the benefits of raising the minimum wage far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

As Millennials, we have the power to advocate for change. Let's use our voices to push for a higher minimum wage and create a more just and equitable society for ourselves and future generations.

What are your thoughts on this issue? Do you believe that the minimum wage should be higher in the United States? Let's discuss!",373,193,0.72,millenials,13,Thursday,Evening

Take a slow look at this image. For a moment, disregard anything she did or did not say and just look at the image. 

I believe this is a very consciously and carefully curated image that is intended to send a message to young women, particularly White suburban millennial women. Again, for just a moment, do not think about what she said, but think about the setting, the staging, the hair and make-up and wardrobe. This image is intended to sell you on a lifestyle. 

What do you think the lifestyle is that the image trying to sell to you? 

Does it work for you? 

Are you attracted to the lifestyle being sold in this image?

(Again, only consider the curated image.)

1b3keus,2024-03-01 03:36:40,What will millennial aesthetic be remembered for?,"Basically zoomers are 100% going to be remembered for the men all growing mushroom bowlcut sand the women all cosplaying like it’s 1998.   Frumpy jeans and frizzy bowls is pretty much SET IN STONE for gen-z.  But how do you reckon millennials will be membered?  

To me as an 87 model I think there’s a notable schism in millennial aesthetics.  Basically there was the constant trend that’s been happening since industrialization where whatever was popular ~30 years cycles through again as the people that were toddlers then are now in control of the industry and set out to recreate the nostalgia from their pre-pubescence.  That’s seen in the 00s-10s trend where we basically cycled through the 70s-80s, particularly with male hair fashion and other stuff.  But then at the same time there was the kind-of-novel thing going on where, on top of the standard 30-year-cultural-echo, there was a kind of inexplicable 100-year-cultural-echo as the “hipster” movement took hold and everyone started cutting their hair like 1910s fascists and wearing Clark’s WW1 boots and generally replicating like late-1890s Switzerland fashion.  

Basically to me, with hindsight, the peak millennial fashion was a relatively-novel mishmash of the standard “whatever was cool 30 years ago is cool now” industrialization meme, combined with the somewhat-absurd obsession with like 1900s-1940s ‘hipster” aesthetics that really kind of jumbled things up and basically set up the lay-up for zoomers to stumble into the middle-parted curly bowlcuts that my mom made me get when I was a moronic 6-year-old with no agency.   I feel bad for zoomers tbh.  There’s never been a time in history where the bowlcut wasn’t looked at as a fucking joke for the 90% of human aesthetic appreciation time that is spent absolutely mocking that fashion.  

Like nobody makes fun of the shaggy 70s look. It went out fashion in the 80s and 20s but it never stopped being cool.   No matter when you look at a picture of a rugged-70s aesthetic man, they’re always kinda rad.  Compare that to how people look back at the mid-90s and right now when bowl cuts hit their peak.  Nobody is proud of their 1990s bowl cut pics, and nobody will look back and be proud of their 2020s bowlcut pics.  And for that, I’m kinda thankful that I’m not a zoomer.  Yeah the hipster shit was kind of embarrassing, but in 200 years the 1920s aesthetic will still be cooler than the 1990s aesthetic.  We made the right call leaning into looking like the Hitler youth and not going full bowl cut.  We will be remembered like the lost/greatest generation and zoomers are doomed to forever be seen as neo-boomers.",43,20,0.81,millenials,7,Friday,Night

I see so much clearer now and am able to feel my emotions for what they actually are - identify them and at least have an opportunity to work on them. If there’s anyone out there struggling like I did for 15 years with failed relationships, just unhappy and unsure why, thoughts of hopelessness and no energy — highly recommend giving sobriety a shot — it’s not easier, it’s just better.

Basically they (Canadian Parliament) is going to be voting on passing a new Bill that would carry hefty fines (70k+) and possible life in prison for ""Hate Speech"".

Problem is they don't define what is ""Hate Speech"" the term has changed / evolved quite a bit over the past 5-10 yrs, so what happens when it is defined by the Government is my question..

They say its to protect Kids from bullying online (great in theory) but its so vague with what they are using to describe things and it seems so open to interpretation but that would be defined by the Government. So its very weird reading this Bill (and the vagueness of the terms) since it would give Government total control of what is and isn't acceptable at any given time which seems pretty fascist when you think about it..

idk maybe I'm wrong here? also they keep saying over and over how its to protect kids and all that (really hammering this point) but shouldnt parents have that right? This just seems like something out of a Movie / Book like 1984 and that sorta thing",5,3,0.8,millenials,6,Wednesday,Morning

1b0qmpv,2024-02-26 19:43:21,The Time Traveler's Guide to NOT Getting Caught,"Hi All, Millenial here, sorry if this post annoys you.  I've always loved history because it's basically the story of us, our species throughout time. One of my favorite things to do is think of historical hypotheticals and imagine a different possible world, so I wrote a time traveling book series and converted it into an audio version. It's called The Time Traveler's Guide to NOT Getting Caught, and it's about a self-centered 25-year-old guy who finds a time traveling watch behind a dumpster, and then he goes back in time and has the craziest, most selfish adventures you can imagine. In the story, he winds up facing several time traveling paradoxes, like when his future self comes back in time to hang out with him. And also, he travels back to relive the glorious 90s.  

This isn't your typical time traveling story, it's like Drunk History meets Hot Tub Time Machine. In the first book, the time traveler goes back to colonial America where he accidentally almost kills a founding father, visits Ancient Athens in search of an epic orgy only to wind up kissing Socrates, and gets trapped on the Titanic as it hits an iceberg. He also meets Isaac Newton, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Davy Crockett, and many more.

The first season is already completely produced (which will have 19 episodes), with new episodes released Thursdays at 8. Seasons 2-4 are already written and in the process of being recorded, so there will be plenty of content. We made this podcast because we realized there's a lot of miserable things happening in the world today, and we all could use a little more levity. There aren't any ads, we just want to make people laugh.

Most of my family and friends are great with their kids and social situations, but I have lots of acquaintances who seem to have no boundaries with their kids. By that I mean bringing children to social events that are by nature adult (think nice sit down dinner hosted by a friend, non-children friendly parties, and lunches that meant to catch up as busy adults) without request or question. Another example is breweries where I have often seen children racing around, running into people, and screaming like it’s a playground. Is this a new cultural norm? Granted I grew up in a generation that saw children told sternly to play in the play room and let the adults talk. I get childcare issues and I am not at all opposed to the inclusion of children in any BBQs, picnics, parties that are clearly family friendly. I understand absolutely the issue of childcare, but why do many not check in to ask or assume that their children are welcome at any venue? Or don’t monitor them to make sure that they don’t take it over (brewery example). I’m honestly curious if I’m off base here. ",163,17,0.56,millenials,2,Saturday,Morning

Do you think it's become less common to do that or was it always uncommon?","When I was a kid, it was pretty common for my dad to pick what we watched, and it would sometimes be something from the 60's or 70's. The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Happy Days, Batman '66, the Smurfs and the whole Hanna Barbera library.  Didn't bother me one bit and to this day I think I still mostly watch older media, even if I haven't got an ounce of nostalgia for it, i'm really starting to get a taste for 70's horror.  Hell, a good chunk of my favorite movies aren't even in color, they're from the 30's and 50's.

But I've noticed a trend for younger generations to almost completely write off anything older than they are except for maybe a handful of Disney Movies and tell me that i'm nostalgia blind for liking older media, even though it's 1. Stuff from before I was born, and 2. I'm also enjoying stuff i've never watched before in 2024.  Hell, my own nephews won't watch a classic Looney Tunes short but they loved the new ones on HBO Max even though they're not that different outside of being animated digitally.

So I just want to know, did it used to be more common for people to enjoy things from before their time and this new wave of writing off older media  is just a newer thing for more recent generations, or was I just weird because I'm watching old ass shows and playing old ass games I didn't grow up with?

EDIT:  I was not factoring music into this because I live under a rock in that regard.  I can see you all have a lot of experience with younger people enjoying older movies.  I guess it's just my own experiences,  It seems more common with video games than it does with TV and movies to completely write off the old stuff, but I do see some insane takes about movies being bad just by virtue of being old.",27,30,0.95,millenials,47,Saturday,Night

I just remember thinking how cool it was to talk to someone from what’s basically a different world at that age. It was such an unusual experience at the time; my folks weren’t loaded but they saw how important computer literacy was going to be and I was one of the first people in my graduating class to have one.  It was a Gateway.  Not sure why this is popping into my head at this particular time in my life, with things the way they are.  it feels… significant maybe.

Anyway, does anyone else have any cool stories from your early days talking to strangers around the world when the internet was just for nerds?

edit: Hey guys, I am already blown away by all the great stories.  This really helped me deal with some difficult feelings.

as a teenager i was a late bloomer and socially behind but i also never really thought about my body as negative or positive, i barely thought about it or noticed it. in college i was drinking a lot and thought my body was changing and i was gaining weight (looking back i think i may have gained like 1 or 2 lbs lmfao) and for the first time was looking at my body critically and became obsessed with my looks and would spent hours pinching my stomach and analyzing it and researching how to eat healthy and exercize etc and basically had some disordered eating issues and ocd but i kind of just got over it. now i just try to eat healthyish and try and walk a much as i can, that time period was exhausting and it's wild that some people are constantly hyperaware of their bodies since they were kids, i couldn't handle that.

is anyone else in the same boat of like... body neutrality?",32,8,0.6,millenials,9,Tuesday,Night

Musk is still quite certain those Optimus humanoids from Tesla will be ready for mass production and sale in 2027, and of course, he thinks everyone should have a humanoid living with them at their house.

He's hoping they'll only be about $20k each, which is actually quite cheap if you ask me.  

Am I just getting old here, or does anyone else think this is a terrible idea?  Are the younger generations all excited about this and can't wait to buy their own personal Johnny 5 to be friends with and to do their bidding?  

I'm wondering whether or not I should get another dog, let alone some super intelligent and super strong artificial intelligent humanoid that doesn't have emotions and doesn't sleep or eat.  Call me old fashioned, but I'll happily take care of the laundry myself.

Do all these people who are so excited for our AI future not remember how human nature works, or something?  Within a week they'll be hacked and we'll have humanoids running around the streets, robbing banks, hijacking high-end cars, selling drugs, conducting gang hits and political assassainations, and so on.

And while I'm ranting, so who exactly decided that it was absolutely imperative we have computers that are more intelligent than humans?  And not just a little more intelligent, but vastly more intelligent to a degree we can't really comprehend.  And not just decide for themselves, but for all of humanity, now and forever in the future.

I don't know about you, but I never got my voter card in tthe mail for this decision.  This is why I don't like people like Sam Altman, and I'm a software engineer myself.  How big of a self important, pretentious asshole do you have to be to think so highly of yourself that you're capable of unilaterally making such a decision?

But, then the world is so fckn chaotic right now, I’ve been OBSESSED with watching the news, and donating to causes, and posting to my social media.   However, things don’t appear to materially change, Palestinians are still being blown to pieces as I type this, kids in the Congo are still digging for minerals in dire conditions, people in Sudan are still experiencing a famine, thousands of Africans every day are drowning when trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, and their bodies washing off on shores…I could go on and on. It all just stays with me every day.     

I become aware of the world around at such an early age that I understood the dysfunction in my household really quick.  Ever since, I’ve been wanting to make a positive impact. 

Fast forward to now, ’m successful in my life with a home, and a well paying job. I volunteer , I donate, I recycle, I educate myself on issues. I even went vegan, but I feel like it’s all pointless.

Sure, I take acid reflux meds daily now and just looking at pizza will give me heartburn, but that's a one off. My left shoulder is a little fucked.

We live near my husband’s parents who own three properties (one is a rental in the Bay Area, one is rural land, and the other is a 50-acre homestead they retired on). 

My husband’s parents were helped their entire life by their own parents. Allowed to rent a family home in the Bay well below market rates for 20 years. Had a grandmother next door as a built in babysitter. Trust fund every year. Inheritance check. 

My husband and I are struggling to get by physically, emotionally, and financially, yet they don’t want to extend that generational help that they received, to us. I’ve asked if we could put a tiny home on their 50 acres to help with my husband’s care as he progresses, it was a no. I’ve asked if they could supplement his loss of income while he’s filling for the long and painful permanent disability process, it was a no. Asked if we could rent the house from them (that they rented) for under market rate, it was a no. 

How can I get his parents to see the help they received from their own parents (for accidentally getting pregnant), is the help we need as chronically ill millennials?

Many would call me a late bloomer. I finally finished college after 10 years on and off at a local state school. I spent 4-5 years at community college where I obtained my associate’s degree. I then earned my bachelor’s in business administration from a local state school 13 years ago, with a GPA of 2.3. I worked in retail and fast food before finding a solid job at a warehouse and now finally being an operations manager, making $98,000 a year. Two years ago, at the age of 38, I bought a 4-bedroom house with a basement and 3.5 bathrooms. Finally, when I purchased a home, my parents and family, especially my father, wanted me to get married. Initially, I said no, but they found a girl that I ended up really liking. She was 24, and we both agreed to marry each other in an arranged marriage. After being engaged for 3 months, I fell in love with her, and we got married last year. I was almost 39, and she was 25. Now, after a year of marriage, my wife and I want to try and have a baby.

I’m also worried because my wife and I have been having unprotected sexual intercourse since our wedding night when we had sex for the first time and consummated our marriage and lost our virginity to each other, and are now hoping to conceive. However, due to my ADHD and financial struggles and poverty growing up thanks to my parents, and especially my dad my credit has been impacted. I’m concerned that I won’t be a better father than my own father. What if I'm too old and won't be alive when my kid graduates high school and college and also I want at least 2 children and so does my wife...

Also my parents are both 71-72 living with me and my wife and I take care of them and my mother already said how she will be here to help as much as she can same as my father but I don’t know.",53,1,0.52,millenials,16,Sunday,Night

1an9z7p,2024-02-10 06:31:27,As a millenial who loves to camp now - how the heck did I survive sleepovers on bedroom floors/field trips as a kid!? Share your sleepover shenanigans here!,"All of my favorite sleepover memories as a kid - whether it was spending a night at my cousins playing Crash Bandicoot till we passed out or the time my boyscout troop slept out in an exhibit hall at the museum of science have one thing in common. A child sized sleeping bag that probably cost $20 (mine was Disney's 101 Dalmations) - MAYBE a pillow.

My memories of the few family camping trips we took as kids always include waking up absolutely freezing - usually with a tree root lodged firmly in my sacrum on bumpy ground. I remember my first sleepover birthday party in 5th grade with a dozen of us sleeping in a friends basement on the cement floor using whatever we could as bedding - I was under a 12x12"" throw pillow as my blanket with my shoes as a pillow.

It is a funny thought to me now who needs an inflatable air mattress with 3.4 R value and 800 fill 23degree mummy bag to even hope for a few hours of shut-eye if I am camping. I even sprung for a packable pillow to really treat myself.  At home I gotta have at least a full size mattress with 3"" memory foam topper, Casper pillow, another pillow under my feet, sheets can't feel too weird and eye covers have become essential in the last couple years.

I was particularly baffled while cleaning out our attic last month and finding 2 old school Coleman sleeping pads which seemed like they were late 80s/early 90s....this technology existed this entire time and I was out there raw dogging the floor/earth in a Disney bodybag!? 

The memory was unlocked for me when mom and I visited that very same Museum of Science earlier this week and she was like ""yup - that's where your sister and I slept on her Girlscout field trip, right over there by the moon lander...Maggie Shanahan threw up on your sister in the middle of the night and then I needed back surgery two months later from sleeping on the floor""

I worked at camps the last few years and these kids get dropped off with Tempurpedic memory foam and duvets and shit and I'm like wtf! What happened to sleeping with a rock in your rib like the good old days!?

However, the rest of the kitchen is always a mess because there is nowhere to put anything. I suggested putting the dinnerware in a heavy duty tub and putting it in storage since they never use them. But her response was that they will get broken and that the cabinet is protecting the sets. 

To me, this makes no sense to me. Why keep like 50ish plates that you never use in a cabinet taking up space while using paper plates for food each day and then complain that theres nowhere to put things? They haven't hosted dinner at their house for years due to the mess as well. I told my parents that if my brother doesnt want them when i inherit them, they are going in the trash.

1ahutwr,2024-02-03 12:15:26,People are off their rockers about kids and technology,"Been reviewing this sub and seen a lot of posts about mellinial parenting with kids and technology. I have to say everyone here is absolutely nuts and almost comically so. ""The kids are glued to screens!!!"" It's a cliche in the making and it happens everytime. In the past video game consoles were supposed to destroy the children and lead to the violent destabilization of society, before that? Having their own phone!, before that? Television!, before that? Radio! Before that? Jazz music! Before that? Easily accessible alchohol!

I could go on another 100 years but it's all culture war BS here's a new flash that every generation needs to hear. Your kids are not going to grow up to be you or be like the kids you grew up with.

They arent playing with toys because toy stores like toys r us went out of business, they aren't watching Arthur or hey Arnold when they get home from school because it isn't subbed, McDonald's isn't a cheap eat for the whole family filled with playplaces for them to play in and you almost certainly are not taking them to exciting locations like Disneyland every year.

You have to foster the things they are interested in and make their world not yours a wonderful adventure. If you're worried about where society is going then you need to vote.

The us education system isn't cripled by parents or electronics it's crippled by the average American who decided to stay home on election day. Don't want schools dictated by fire arm drills? Then vote and get a godamn weapons ban passed. Don't want teachers fleeing schools in droves? Then vote to get everyone a living wage and to empower unions. Want mom(or dad) to stay home and play with the kids? Then vote and make godamn maternity(paternity)leave, subsidized day care, or a meaningful child tax credit a real thing.

The problems not the parenting it's that too many butts are glued to the fence of apathy. 

I'm going to end my rant with a poem by Khalil Gibran

     Your children are not your children.
     They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
     They come through you but not from you,
     And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

     You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
     For they have their own thoughts.
     You may house their bodies but not their souls,
     For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
     You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
     For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
     You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
     The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
     Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable



Edit: I don't have time to respond to or read every comment here and there are certainly a lot of rational folks here with reasonable opinions but there is also a lot that concerns me.

I honestly hope this subreddit is not representative of my generation because the amount of you commenting who have learned nothing from the mistakes of the past is shockingly high.

Honestly people commenting here are as out of touch as the previous generations that they complain about. So many are quick to blame technology and change just because things are different from their own childhood. 

I have seen many people commenting here certain that children are up a creek because of their access to technology, or because of trans rights, or video games, ECT... 

But inequality, lack of healthcare, lack of funding, and easy access to guns just fly right under the radar of most of the people commenting here. 

My only take away has been that if the comments of this place are in fact representative of my generation then unfortunately the next generation will inherit all of these issues. All while we whine on the sidelines about how the poor shouldn't be permitted to be parents or that childrens phone usage is turning them braindead and unable to read or that they have become socially stunted and don't use the right bathroom!

The shortsightedness is deafening, I just hope it's isolated.

Second edit 

This part I just have to share for irony's sake. The number of people linking studies that they say definitively proves electronics drastically damage learning, reading, socialization, and ECT...   When the studies actually do no such thing and go out of their way to say so pointing out they have no causal association and frequently rely on self reporting is really high and it is deliciously funny. The irony of someone linking studies arguing illiteracy that they didn't read...

But if you are fed up by the powerlessness you face, then stand firm against it and move forward with all your heart and soul. If you have nothing to lose, then try to lose it. 

Always stick to non-violence, but aside from that, you have the right to choose to break whatever laws you deem fit. When the law goes only one way, there is no law. 

I call everybody to stop supporting a system that assaults us, steals from us, and bends us into submission. Makes us its tools against our own well-being. Make it known if you do not stand for it. This is about every issue that has come and gone. Every issue that has been brought to light and conveniently forgotten. Make it known. 

A country that refuses to use the law to protect the common people, and instead uses it to enrich and protect our oppressors, has lost the privilege of our support. 

And if you are fine with the direction of the world, of the country, of economic prospects and realities, of the ruling by faceless entities and wealthy elites, then do nothing. If you are satisfied that your ballot is enough, and that it has been working as intended, then do nothing. You have chosen your side. 

Just remember who you cooperate with, and who you stand against. Inaction is action itself. As Ghandi also said, “Noncooperation with evil is as much a duty as cooperation with good.”

Unfortunately companies today don’t really offer pensions anymore. I’ve read several times that there won’t be any social security for us when we get near retirement age. It will have run out before then. We’re paying into today’s social security benefit receivers while we get the shaft come retirement. And that’s assuming if most millennials will ever even be able to retire.  

Sky high housing costs, high mortgage rates, they keep wondering why people aren’t having children as much anymore. When the cost of rent and food DOUBLES in just a few years, what the fuck do they expect?! SHIT COST TOO MUCH!",609,209,0.71,millenials,6,Monday,Night

My teens and early 20s were spent trying to recover from trauma a severe eating disorder,  and I did manage to mostly do that. 
When I was in my mid 20s I worked for a big company in FL that many dream of working for. Originally the plan was to work for them in a more professional role and have a ""good"" career doing something I loved. I was finally going to get ahead and I was determined! I moved across the country and I was going to do it!

However, my social anxiety and anxiety in general got the better of me as I worked for the big dream company in a minimum wage-ish job (more like 4 dollars above minimum wage but still unliveable) and could only afford low class apartment living, literally living with roaches. I could hardly manage part time hours due to my anxiety and my partner worked full time and even with our joint income we struggled and had to continually ask one of his parents to help me ends meet. 

Then 2020 hit. We lost our jobs. Then a hurricane  hit, and our apartment flooded. Worse, they informed us after the water was cleaned up, our rent was going to rise 300$ a month. The whole situation was traumatic.

We ended up having to leave the state and move back to my hometown and now have been living in his mom's basement for the last year.
He finally got a job, paying 65k a year but after taxes, only 49k a year... and he's highly skilled with a bachelors degree. 
I feel like we're never going to get ahead. I also hold a bachelor's but haven't been able to get a job. I know that's negative thinking but the last ten years of my life, where have they even gone?!

I need a job I can work remotely because of my anxiety. All this high paying jobs requiring you to be 5 people and do 3 peoples jobs.. I'm just not cut out for it and I feel devastated and like a failure.

And the thing is I'm so tired.
 We have no savings, no 401k, and I feel like all of the dreams I've had for my life have disappeared. I have nightmares about the hurricane and just the lack life ahead of me. 
I don't even know why I'm posting this, I just don't have friends my own age and I'm just hoping someone can relate or something. Thanks for listening.",9,20,0.88,millenials,17,Monday,Night

1aclax0,2024-01-27 21:18:57,50% of American Boomers have less than $100k in Retirement. 50% of American Homeless are Boomers.,"I learned recently that half of all American Boomers have less than $100k in retirement savings left and that 50% of the homeless population in America are Boomers. Which cuts into the myths that all Boomers are living high on the hog. 

I do find this interesting though. A few years back I never could have fathomed that the most greedy and selfish generation in American history would have HALF its populations in dire straits during MY lifetime. 

They happily invited that Spawn of Satan Ronald Reagan to dismantle every program and institution that was the backbone and safety net of the American worker. They voted for him with glee. As he chanted ""Greed is Good."" They cheered him on as he decimated entire communities deemed ""undesirable"" by the majority. They cheered for him as he cut funding to everything that enriched and improved the lives of Americans. All for this same generation to now represent 50% of the homeless. Only for HALF of this same generation to be unprepared for retirement. 

They didn't just screw future generations. They screwed themselves. Apparently there ARE swift consequences for our actions.

EDIT: I want to revise one small part of this post (I can't change the title). The number was 45% of the current homeless population is Boomers. The link to where I learned this information is below:

I’m in the opposite boat. My parents are both are pretty clear in the fact that they will not be helping me raise any grandkids, and are not interested in the idea of being grandparents. 

I’m recently married and my husband (and his parents, who are the best in laws ever) really want kids/grandkids. To them, having kids is just what you do and an essential part of life. Quite the revelation to me. I wasn’t sure until recently if I even wanted kids, but now I think I do. My birth was an accident, not even a planned pregnancy. My dad is re-married with a second family and my mom does not want to be a grandparent. She didn’t have a great relationship with her parents and neither did I, so I understand her just wanting the trauma cycle to end. 

I guess I’m just struggling with the idea of becoming a parent and feeling very alone with no extended family support except for his parents who live in a different state.

Again, it's a branding and marketing thing.

Whereas Boomers were fed propaganda about ""the self made man"" and accomplishing things on their own (which led to most boomers having no idea how any system they inherited works)

Gen X was designed to rage against the system but then self implode with the enormity of what it means to topple and empire

Gen Y was designed to come next and to question the existence of the fabric of reality and society, and given that the Boomers do not know how anything works, society was supposed to mostly crumble when Gen Y decided it was all bullshit and fairytales.  They cut the program early because it turned out asking ""Why"" leads people to understanding, and many of us learned things about the system Boomers and Gen X still do not understand.  For this reason, they cut over early to Miley Cyrus and the millennial program which are based on nihilism and narcissism.

I would’ve considered it, but the ongoing images/videos coming out of Palestine are simply too much to bear for me. I cannot believe my hard-earned tax dollars are funding a genocide. I’ve become a staunch anti-Zionist as a result. 

The more I learned about the brutal occupation, daily humiliation, the Nakba, the organ harvesting, the siege, the blockade, the desecration of graves, the fact that everything coming into Gaza should be approved, that their water, electricity, food are all controlled. 

I was a Bernie guy, but even him was a disappointment. As I look around and talk to millennial friends, most don’t even want to be bothered with voting at all.

She ALWAYS made sure all my siblings got our mail-in ballots each time election cycle. 

FYI, I’m genuinely asking…So, please, no need for the vote shaming…As I do not particularly care. 
I’m neither a “bot”, russian, or trying to influence anyone to vote any which way, and have NEVER voted Republican in my life. But again, whatever floats your boat.

As a progressive, the concept of voting for the “lesser of 2 evils” AKA harm reduction has never appealed to me. Also, if a democracy is at stakes every 4 years, then do we indeed have a democracy to begin with?
The fear mongering by the Dems is so tired. I do not think they truly understand the general displeasure with Biden (at least in my community). 

I acknowledge that this may be a privileged decision as my life wasn’t necessarily impacted by the previous Trump presidency…and I do pretty good for myself overall.

I don't know, there may be advantages to using artificial intelligence, but I only know many disadvantages, which are:

\-Plagiarism (since at my time plagiarism was less serious or depending on the degree, we did not have artificial intelligence, the artificial intelligence we had was ""google"");

\-Get test answers;

\-Losing a job or being replaced by machines during employment, whether during hiring progress and other factors;

 \-Robbery schemes;

 \-Suspension at school;

\-And among other factors.

With these disadvantages, I don't know if I should trust artificial intelligence and if I should use it for good and not for bad use and why has ChatGPT grown a lot in recent years and doesn't it seem scary?

**Edit:** thanks all so much for replying. there's so much replies and I could not reply to everyone individually, but here is some things:

* this topic is controversial. 170 replies and only 20 upvotes.
* /r/Millennials subscribers are an american bunch. almost all replies came from the States.
* I am shocked as a northern European that Racism is still such a blatant and systemic issue in your country. (Editedit - yes there is a lot of systemic racism too in Europe, and one is not better than the other, i'm not pointing fingers)
* However, I mean the racism that was still there until the 1960's/MLK/Rosa Parks. I think **y'all should be start calling it Apartheid**, because that is what it literally is. Racism is too unspecific and downplaying it. it is an 1. Active 2. Systemic 3. discrimination on race 4. of multiple groups. Thats just bad and evil and of course the USA is seeing the consquences of that in more personalized racism nowadays. [also check this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/millenials/comments/194wk3s/comment/khp2cxv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* until now, here is a theory: it seems that the post broadband internet-era (y2k and beyond) has dispersed culture much more in the states, it became more the same instead of North vs South:
   * The north became more outwardly racist - but the tensions were already there in 90's but more faux pas to speak about, so that was ""the irony"" of calling asians slant-eyes or spicks etc. as ""jokes""
   * The south was extremely racist, and continues to be so, but maybe Is really influenced by all the BLM things, maybe a few less people say N\* a few less times and that is change, people. change is very slow so please be optimistic. propaganda works! there will be always more young kids that are like "" screw this, i'm leaving this place"" when there are those pamphlets around them about race, gender, etc than there would be when there is none
* Gay Bashing was real. I feel for everyone being abused that way. it maybe was a remnant of puritan values from waaaay back? at least, the whole 9/11 thing and leaving  George Bush and ""family values""  behind seems to have hugely turned that over culturally for the better, so thats a good thing. too bad it also brought Trump. 
* please go to therapy people! Change comes from within and our generation has witnessed and experienced a lot that was not ok. there are 180 replies currently of abuse in this thread, simply because you were born in that era doesnt make it better. all the love!

**I'll bite of the bullet:**

When I was a kid, in a middle sized city in the Netherlands:

* Lots of fighting but especially a looot agression
* Lots of racist jokes about minorities, out in the open
* lots of bullying, controlling and/or toxic behaviours

all this was out in the open, both by fellow kids and adults. even more bizarre: it was completely accepted.

 I've experienced firsthand the challenges and complexities of our legal  and political systems. That's why I founded Just Liberty Incorporated  and developed two transformative platforms: Just Legal and Just  Politics. 

&#x200B;

**Just Legal**: Demystifying the Legal System

&#x200B;

* **Innovative Legal Flowchart Software**: Guides users through various legal processes interactively, simplifying legal jargon and procedures.
* **User-Friendly and Secure**: Prioritizes accessibility and security, making legal navigation intuitive and safeguarding user data.
* **Versatile for Various Legal Scenarios**: Whether it's criminal, family, civil, or other legal matters, Just Legal provides comprehensive assistance.
* **Advanced Conversational AI**: Helps users understand their legal situation, draft documents, and advocate for their rights.
* **Comprehensive Legal Assistant**: Tracks cases, offers legal options, and provides resources for informed decision-making.
* **100% Free Service**: Ensuring access to legal help for everyone, regardless of financial constraints.
* **Continuous Enhancement**: Adapting to emerging technologies to meet the evolving needs of society.

&#x200B;

**Just Politics**: Engaging Voters with Value-Based Questioning

* **Deep Dive into Individual Values**: Tailors information to each user's beliefs and priorities for a personalized experience.
* **Balanced Overview of Candidates and Issues**: Offers unbiased pros and cons, empowering voters to make informed decisions.
* **Citizen-Driven Lobbying**: Democratizes lobbying, allowing users to advocate for policy changes effectively.
* **Real-Time Expenditure Tracking**: Brings transparency to government spending at all levels.
* **Secure Voting Mechanisms**: Ensures the integrity and accuracy of the electoral process.
* **Enhanced Community Engagement**: Facilitates dialogue and collaborative action within communities.
* **Educational Content and Resources**: Provides knowledge to demystify complex political topics.
* **Blockchain Technology**: Implements blockchain for an immutable public record, transparency in voting, and financial tracking.

&#x200B;

Both Just Legal and Just Politics are more than tools; they are movements towards a future where everyone is empowered and informed in their legal and political journeys. I invite you to join this revolution and help us bring these modern solutions to our modern problems.

&#x200B;

Your support, whether as developers, programmers, blockchain experts, volunteers, influencers, or donors, is invaluable in bringing these platforms to life. Visit [truejust.org](http://truejust.org/) to learn more and become a part of this transformative journey.

191m0jc,2024-01-08 14:07:59,What sincere advice would you give Generation Z?,"For all the grousing that gets done on this subreddit, I feel we have something to offer those of us with more road ahead of them.  I mean, our formative adult years got 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, COVID, and an attempt to storm the U.S. Capitol.  We've seen some stuff, we've gotten through some stuff.  If you had a Gen Z captive audience, where you could say ""Look, this is some of what's coming, here's what you gotta know and gotta execute on,"" what would you tell 'em?

For me, and in no particular order: 

1. **Have a plan, identify concrete steps towards accomplishing it, and be brutal in your self-assessment and on the in-between steps.**  The world is just too fast-paced these days to float through your 20s and beyond and still come out on the other end reasonably close to where you want to be in terms of life goals, finances, etc.  Unfortunately, that means identifying your personal win condition real early and sacrificing over the long term to get from A to B.  Assume that the cavalry is not coming to your rescue.  Either curl up in a ball or get moving.  Your win condition may change with time, but always be moving towards it, whatever it is.
2. **Know your budget down cold**. Half the battle in the lean years is knowing what number you have to set aside each month. Half the battle in later years is making sure lifestyle creep doesn't happen. 
3. **401k/RothIRA/TSP**. You max out that match for the free money. That is as essential as your rent payment.
4. **Your raises are not all yours to spend**. Somewhere between 20-50% of your future salary increases go to savings. By all means use some of it on the daily to make life more enjoyable, but you're playing the long game. It sucks up front, but it sure feels good later when backbreaking emergencies for others are just annoyances for you.
5. **Remember that, for all this, you are not your job**.  Even if you're one of those high-achiever types, there will come a point where you will stop working.  Don't just be a drone.
6. **Car**. If you managed to buy one back when car loans were at 2% interest, congratulations. If you need a car, get a used Chevy Cruze or equivalent, or if determined to buy new, a Kia Sentra or VW Jetta. Regardless, you are getting a compact with good fuel efficiency and it is now your car for the next 10-15 years unless your life situation materially improves before then. If you can avoid 7 years of car payments, that's about $25,000 you are not spending so some piece of metal can sit in a parking lot most of the day.
7. **Live close to work as is reasonable.**  You have roughly 16 waking hours each day.  You're going to lose at 8-9 of them to work, and another hour to morning and evening routine.  Of the remaining 6 hours or so left, do you really want to spend a third of that driving, and paying all that gas?  If you can nab a telework job, that is like *gold*, particularly if you're looking to start a family.
8. **7+ hours of sleep is non-negotiable.**  Yes, you can power through no problem, but the difference between being serviceable and being rested starts becoming much bigger in your 30s.  Start now, feel better and younger longer.
9. **Learn to cook well**. Especially if you're the type that likes to eat out a lot. Less expensive, useful skill to have, and you have full control of the menu.
10. **Booze and drugs.** Stay away from 'em. I've seen (and represented) too many people who threw away their future and their families due to liquor or edibles.
11. **Know the difference between fact and opinion, and how much weight to put in one or the other.**  Feelings are excellent gap fillers. They are opinions based on the sum total of your experiences and instincts.  They help you make decisions with incomplete information.  They do not get to supplant reality.  Similarly, just because someone has the same opinion as you does not mean you're both right.

I just finished the book All This Could Be Different by Sarah Thankam Mathews. Description below:

&#x200B;

Graduating into the long maw of an American recession, Sneha is one of the fortunate ones. She’s moved to Milwaukee for an entry-level corporate job that, grueling as it may be, is the key that unlocks every door: she can pick up the tab at dinner with her new friend Tig, get her college buddy Thom hired alongside her, and send money to her parents back in India. She begins dating women—soon developing a burning crush on Marina, a beguiling and beautiful dancer who always seems just out of reach.

But before long, trouble arrives. Painful secrets rear their heads; jobs go off the rails; evictions loom. Sneha struggles to be truly close and open with anybody, even as her friendships deepen, even as she throws herself headlong into a dizzying romance with Marina. It’s then that Tig begins to draw up a radical solution to their problems, hoping to save them all.

&#x200B;

It was a wonderful read. Published in 2022. As a millennial who graduated college in 2009, it did such a great job of characterizing the uncertainty of coming of age in that time period and how difficult it was just to make ends meet. The main character also has the added challenge of being an immigrant, but the whole novel took me back to that period of time in my life, both the good and the bad.

Can't recommend it enough and thought other millenials who had a similar experience struggling to find their way after college or just in general would enjoy it. It's extremely well-written and it's you know, a tad early, but I suspect it will be one of my favorites of the year even in 11 months.",0,9,0.91,millenials,19,Monday,Afternoon

For some reason, they believe they built the world they grew and thrived in. We know the history. We know their parents and grand daddies fought the Nazis, built the rockets, and then piloted these rockets.  


They? They applauded when the rockets were shut down. And the education became primarily a business.

&#x200B;

I don't expect them to know this. Nor I should. You shouldn't for certain. 

&#x200B;

The world is shit. I'm still not dead yet. And thankfully I'm not senile yet.   


I think we can still do something. Maybe not fix everything. But at least, for ourselves, soften the impact a bit.

I posted my story and got WAY more messages about women suffering the same fate than I would have expected. Of course, we are demystifying what used to be kept hush hush (my grandmother told me she referred to her two miscarriages that ended with a D&C “dusting and cleaning”). But I also can’t help but to believe with the increasing amount of chemicals and environmental pollution, we may just be the most infertile generation and those of us who desperately seek children are just unable to have them.",565,690,0.89,millenials,8,Friday,Afternoon

I’m aware that black women are already at a disadvantage in the dating world in Atlanta 😅. Even in church, I catch myself sometimes scoping around every now and then…but it seems that all the men there are already spoken for.

I just want to know if there are single men out there who actually do attend church. Maybe knowing that there is a portion of men who do go, will give me a sliver of hope to potentially meet a nice guy in this setting.

18myjox,2023-12-20 16:25:22,Is distrusting my employer a generational trait?,"So I got a letter today offering me 20000 “units”, which seem to be class b shares, of the private equity firm that owns my company. My instinct is that they’re trying to push some sort of company debt or something off on me. I distrust it and want to reject it, in spite of the possible future benefit that owning these shares may give me. 

So talking to other folks around my age (42) or younger they all would immediately distrust it. I admit that I don’t know enough about how that sort of thing works, but I was given a little insight into it. My gut reaction remains, however, that the company is doing this because it’s good for THEM, not for me. They could very much care less about me or my well being, they want profit and revenue. How would it benefit the company to give me these things freely and without me asking. If I was happy with my compensation, not that I am but I never said anything, why would they just do this unless it benefited the company above all else. 

Older folks seem to just be like “it’s probably fine”. So I don’t know. Seems like at a certain point we learned to distrust employers.

Edit: I have real reason to distrust them. When I was hired they changed part of my compensation package without telling me, hiding it behind a vague name. When they promoted me this year, they told me they would do two things out loud that didn’t manifest. So there’s been lies from them already. ",16,15,0.8,millenials,7,Wednesday,Afternoon

18m45jz,2023-12-19 15:12:09,AMERICAN INDIVIDUALISN IS A SCAM,"I am referring to that BS about kicking kids out of the household at 18.


Thing has never been any more of a scam.


Reading history about the rest of the world, it's easy to see why there are big cities filled with sardine can multi-story buildings, while America is filled with downthrodden mutil-family buildings.


Not gonna sugar coat it. The past was bulshit too. Many of the Boomers were not the result of a mutual agreement between Grandpa and Grandma. But the result of a drunkard and another person without a say in the event that followed. 


Also, family ""traditions"" allowed for a lot of shit to happen and be kicked under the rug.


But, economically speaking, there was a bonus.


One couple would start a household. Have kids. Then, the kids grow up. 


That's where things kickstart.


Instead of living the household, the new grown-ups get a partner. Then, start adding up to the initial small house of the original couple. Instead of starting up small, from literal zero, each new couple can now focus on making wealth.


Instead of the elderly getting unable to handle more and more tasks as time passes, they get additional workforce from their second and third generations.


Mothers have problems taking care of children? Grandma and siblings aid in childcare. No problem going to school or work.


Men have to learn household maintenance, as the property is collectively owned. So each one better learn how to fix things and build things.


There is no need for retirement homes or nursing homes. The elderly has the protection and companionship of their own family.


Sure, there has to be order. Abusive, problematic (thievery, scam, vandalism) or aggressive members should not be allowed in the household.

18ly7j0,2023-12-19 09:47:21,Getting the most bang for your buck in the kitchen,"Merry holidays everyone.  I just wanted to discuss maybe looking at the kitchen differently if you are having struggles with groceries.  These are my tips that work for me.  I am a single female no kids.  I hope to also maybe see if you have advice of your own that I might incorporate into my routine.  

Starting off the christmas gift I got myself was groceries.  Though I made it a point to stock my kitchen well with staples and spices.  I went out and bought flavors I normally don’t buy so I can taste other things.  Example would be getting agave nectar instead of maple syrup.  I got egg nog for my coffee instead of milk. 

I have stopped buying perishables and fresh veggies that I know will spoil if I don’t use them quickly enough.  For me that would be like a bag of spinach when I might just want a cup of spinach. 

So my actual refrigerator is pretty barren in terms of items. I keep things like eggs, salad dressing, cheese, yogurt.  Things that will keep long shelf life.  I also only use the front visual depth of my fridge.  Things never get pushed back.  Keep your fridge shallow so there is less waste.  

I keep a bucket full of rice probably about 25 lbs worth.  Today when I went Christmas cubbard stock shopping I bought noodles of different color, quinoa, flax seed, a gallon sized quacker oats.  I always have an abundance of oatmeal instead of granola.  Stock up on pasta and grain alternatives. 

I stocked up on banana bread, cake mix, brownie mix, etc.  so when I feel like something sweet I’m not wasting money on an abundance of junk food and I can at least commit to baking something delicious with minimal hassle. 

For veggies I buy the assembled pre made bags in the frozen section and use ziplock bags to portion out a quart size of veggies. Essentially breaking down each package into grabbable meal sized single portions.  I can defrost it for later or grab it for dinner and microwave at work.  Same with meat.  

I buy meat that I might not need now.  Sandwich meat, plethora of chicken or hamburger.  Again break it down into single portion sizes or make 2 meals. I buy good bacon if it’s on sale buy one get one or buy one get half off.  My point is if it’s something you don’t need now.  Buy it anyway and stock it for later.  I freeze my yogurt, cheeses, sandwich meat, bread for later.  Take out of freezer when you need it. 

Splurge and buy spices and sauces.  I might have the same sausage and broccoli but it tastes different depending on the sauces I am using.  I also don’t leave my spices in the back of the cabinet to die.  I have a basket and about 40 ziploc bags of spices I take down when I cook.  I just pinch my dry spices out of the ziploc when I need it.  They don’t stay in plastic bottles where I can’t access them. 

I spent about 230 today.  It will keep my staples stocked for at least 3 months.  When I shop every week to 2 weeks I spend about 60. Because I’m just buying bread, milk, dog food, tortillas, yogurt.  Really just replacement staples.  

I also shop the perimeter of my store.  Less processed foods.  I buy deals / bogos.  Sometimes higher end grocery stores will have things nearing expiration. I make about 12 bucks an hour.  I’m never starving though  or seeking to eat out. 

Example: I just cooked eggs with toast, shredded bag cheese with salt pepper but I used coconut oil for a flavor change because I bought it buy one get one.  I also just sided it with Greek yogurt because I have 3 in my freezer but added a bit of banana and agave nectar. 

I started keeping a loose lazy food journal in my sketch book where I rate my random combos.  I’m to lazy for complex recipes. Sometimes I make random combos I will want to make later. 

TLDR : stock up your kitchen with staples.  Buy more and freeze.  Portion control.  Most of your money should be aimed at good spices and sauces so you don’t feel food poor.  The refrigerator is where things go to die and be wasted. Keep the fridge shallow. More dry goods. More frozen. ",1,6,0.88,millenials,10,Tuesday,Morning
18kzh0p,2023-12-18 03:50:07,Millenials are a chill generation,"To be honest, I feel millenials are somewhat more mature in a lot of subjects than a lot of other generation. 

Less tendencies to extremism, generally anti-censorship but understand decency, calm and open to constructive discussions. They have environment at heart, and generally had a great time partying and having fun growing. 

Not only this, but I feel they understand the importance of not taking things too seriously, prefering social harmony to imposing ideas on everyone.

I feel generation X lose their temper quickly, and that Z don't want to listen to different opinions. 

Maybe it is just my perception, maybe it is only my area, but each time I met someone of my generation, I generally get along with that person, wathever our race, origin or sexual orientation. 

I am sure that it is not like that everywhere, but I find it really common.

But for me, like damn, something about the pandemic seems to have just unlocked some people's crazy and they have never gone back. 

I had a cousin in the UK who, in her 20s, went from atheism to full on Muslim, married and pregnant within a year and some change. Her mother became a vehement COVID denier and tried to visit my dad who was recovering from cancer WHILE SHE HAD COVID. We haven't spoken since. 

One of my oldest friends started unapologetically defending nazis present at the freedom convoy here in Canada and has gone full anti-vaxx, anti-lockdown...and he's an educator. :/

Another seems to have had their breaking point from the Israel/Palestine conflict and refuses to even entertain the idea that what Israel is doing to Palestinians might be bad. Like she is legit calling for blood, and she's not even Israeli! And she's studying to be a therapist!

Still *another* found a husband online during the pandemic who got her into shrooms and now she writes long blog posts about how what we really needed to cure COVID was the power of hugs and human connection (despite that y'know, being the very thing that was killing and disabling people during the pandemic). 

Other than these examples, a lot of my friendships are also just...fizzling out. And I get it, I'm in my mid 30s and people have kids and lives. But it feels like before the pandemic there were at least attempts for us all to keep each other in our lives. It just seems gone now. Everyone seems exhausted and miserable. And I include myself in that, too. Sometimes it feels like a herculean effort to try and get something started. 

As I write this, I'm sitting here on my PC tonight missing the MSN days.

Mine literally couldnt provide us with food, school supplies, housing and clothing adaquately and often times chose things like drugs and hoarding over providing for us. My husbands parents are considered upper middle class, refused to pay for his college out of pocket and had him sign parent plus loans to go to school, went on international vacations sometimes yearly, and continue to this day to live out of their means and his dad's $1,000,000 severence package (was paid out in like 2018-19) at this point will not support them to the end with how they spend. Meanwhile, my kids never suffer from how much we struggle. They are always provided for and while we are not homeowners (due to this terrible economy) we do okay. However our boomer parents continue to always try and put their 2 cents in about how we handle finances they know nothing about, nor do they take the time to understand the economic predicament millenials are in to try and relate. Just exhausted myself having a conversation with my mother about sending my son's teacher (our age too) classroom supplies/snacks and she could not comprehend that teachers are expected to pay that out of pocket bc that is not how school was for her.

They’re now partnered with ID.me, a third party company who verifies and authenticates identities. In order to successfully submit a payment to them, it’s now required for you to submit photo of your driver’s license along with entering other personal information.

My question is this: Why is this necessary? Not like the government doesn’t have access to that information already. What really sketches me out, is that in the terms and conditions, you’re giving ID.me permission to share your personal information. They use this third party site to help “prevent” fraud - which is a bunch of baby back bullshit. If anything, this site seems more susceptible to fraud. Nobody actually knows where or who this information is being shared to, but if we don’t accept these terms and not pay the IRS, our bank accounts will be levied. Seems like another one of the governments shiesty schemes and the innocent people fall victim to it once again. 

Oh and almost forgot to mention, if you accept these terms and set up a payment plan like I did because you don’t want your bank account levied and because we cannot simply live without money - be prepared to pay an astronomical amount of interest!! 

I always found it ironic that the IRS can take their sweet time when it comes to paying you back money that’s owed (also interest free), yet when you owe them, they demand it immediately with a knife to your throat. And if you can’t pay them right away, they charge an arm and leg in interest or freeze your assets. 

I’m a father of two, soon to be three, struggling in this capitalistic society.

Combined zoomers and millennials constitute a majority, add in x'ers and its an overwhelming majority. We could effectively form a voting block along generational lines. 

Are you psyched for the upcoming election? Do really think it actually matters who gets elected president? This is what I'm proposing: young people write in some kind of politically neutral public figure, such as Nick Offerman (the guy from parks and rec), for every elected office they can. We continue to do this for every state and federal level election until student loans are forgiven and social security is phased out or until Nick Offerman becomes elected the president of the united states.

16o4fwt,2023-09-21 02:48:56,Parenting my parents: concerns over my mom's excessive screen time,"Hi everyone, this post is going to be about parenting one's own parents. To preface, I am an eldest child in my family and a woman in my mid twenties. My parents are also immigrants. Lately, I have become more and more concerned about my mother's excessive screen time on her iPad. Usually, you hear talk about screen time regarding the excessive usage among children. But screen addiction/excessive screen use can happen to anyone. In this case, my mom is an iPad adult and is glued to the screen first thing in the morning and immediately after coming back from work. A YouTube video is on during dinner time. It is on the table while the rest of my family is eating and trying to engage in conversation with her. Her favorite app is YouTube, and I am noticing that the kinds of videos she is watching/videos that the algorithm is now feeding her are really mind numbing and...childish? It will be really clickbait-y stuff about police apprehending a ""criminal"" or a  luxury shopping haul or a mukbang or a family vlog channel. I understand it's okay to consume this stuff in moderation, and I do it as well, but this type of idiotic content is taking over her life for hours on end. She has become less social, more irritable, and totally unwilling to go to events in the city or places in my neighborhood, such as the park. In addition, I noticed that the content she is watching is really getting to her brain. She can no longer speak in complete sentences and when she does, she regurgitates an idiotic talking point that reinforces a worldview that is racist, sexist, homophobic, or pro-cop. I can tell that it makes her fearful of the world and encourages her to spend more time holed up inside. This is really scary because the alt-right pipeline on social media is very real.

I bring up the fact that my mom is an immigrant because it adds context to show that the rest of her social life is really lacking. She has no adult friends that she hangs out with--at all. She has some family members she keeps in contact with via the phone and social media, but this really has dwindled when my aunt (her closest confidant) died about ten years ago. She only has my dad to socialize with. Her relationship with me is also strained as she never has emotionally matured. So I think that perhaps her excessive screen time is a way to get socialization done, except that this is only happening online and with no back and forth between her and anyone else. I am trying to drag her to the library but she has no interest. Her attention span is wired to click on clickbait (""I just spent one million dollars on a Tesla! \*shock emoji\*"" kind of stuff).

Today, I went into her iPad and set a YouTube screen time limit for eight hours because she was home all day due to having the day off. She reached that cap at about 3pm, but opened YouTube on her phone right after and kept watching. After always being ridiculed for being an angsty teen who was constantly texting, seeing this amount of screen time from her was shocking, but depressing mainly. As much as I am raising this issue out of me being in shock or fearful that she'd fall into the pipeline, this situation is depressing most of all because it shows that she has no real friends or hobbies. She is also possibly depressed, but as an immigrant from elsewhere she believes that mental illness is nonsense (and that I just don't have the willpower to overcome the depression that I am medicated for). I am fearful of what her future might look like when she retires and my siblings and I aren't there to socially engage with her each day. I want to sign her up for classes or events where she can socialize with other adults but she absolutely refuses to go, she evidently has social anxiety. I feel like the roles have reversed and I have become her parent -- it is frustrating and concerning and I just don't know what the fuck to do with her.

I tried r/venting and r/relationship_advice but my posts keep getting removed for one reason or another and I just need to let this out of my body.

I'm 35, she's 33. We've been dating for three years.

 I take home $3.8k/month after taxes. She makes about the same. I've got at least three years left on *one* of my student loans.  I've also got about $27k in debt on one credit card, and about $14k split on 2 care credit cards. Aggressively... I could knock these out in a few years via snowball and complete conservation/focus and perhaps with promotions it could be quicker. 3 years I speculate (without promotion etc).

Full breakdown:

- 1200 rent
- 200 electric (its hot here, but also my girlfriend insists our apartment is below 70 degrees.)
- 100 water/sewer
- 230 phone bill
- 470 studen loan
- 240 care credit
- 210 care credit
- 500 credit card
- 60 internet bill

She pays for the car/insurance and groceries (about $300/m) and then gives me an additional $500/month. It comes out to about the same.

3 years to crawl out.. even the total debut doesnt sound terrible.. but it's extremely difficult for me to stay within budget. And that puts me at 38 and her at 35 respectively. That's IF the next three years were extremely restricted... and honestly we don't even have a single month of that kind of accountability or responsibility.

Out of the money I have left after bills every month I try to keep my spending to $300 every two weeks and hopefully save $500 every month. That hasn't happened. There is always something that she wants to do or that I end up paying for that just isn't In the budget.

This allows me basically to get us dinner and a few drinks at the bar one night- with maybe a few snacks during that two week time. Gas for the car. 

My girlfriend and I pretty much have everything split... except she doesn't have debt and her paychecks are starting to rival and exceed mine.  She knows our money situation.. but it's difficult when she wants to go on dates etc and I cannot provide for any of this and remain on a budget.

We want to get married. Have children. Get a house. She's looking at houses that are like $400k... I'm thinking that is not a possibility for a good 5-10 years... if ever.. and that's if we are really focused on that goal. I mention this and she becomes all sad and is like *""do you really think it will take that long""* 😥😥 Average wedding is like $30k... neither of us come from money or have any money saved. Not to mention a ring... 

33 is beginning to be geriatric level for having a baby.. and honestly I can't forsee affording a baby for at least another year or two at best. I'd prefer to get married first as well but honestly that just pushes the whole operation down the line another year or so.

I think I've waited too long to make these corrections to my debt. I love my girlfriend- and I know she loves me too- but I know we both want those things I've talked about above and it's just a heavy weight to manage and rationalize and plan. 

Between the stress of her asking for dates and going out and spending all this money on whatever... meanwhile she has no debt. I dunno. 

I know what I have to do to get clear but it's going to take time and focus and she wants my time and gets angry when I try and work on this future. There is a lot of sacrifice involved. A lot. 

Not only that but she begged for us to get into this nicer apartment.. where now I'm paying like $400 more than I was a year ago... it's hard managing this shit. I know *I would be fine* living in a cheaper apartment for the time being... but she has all these conditions.

 I quit smoking recently and just can't seem to fucking deal. She wants to buy marijuana often- and i have wanted to quit for ahwile... just realign.. focus.. not spend money on that. Since she buys though she makes me feel bad when i dont participate in one of the 10 times she smokes a day. I could also cut drinking out but I realize she wants to get out of the apartment (we both work from home.)

I love my girlfriend but I don't know if I can provide for her and achieve those goals within a decent time frame. I want her to have the opportunity to have those things. Its hard getting on the same page and setting a budget. I feel like maybe I'm slowing her down or that she isn't able to commit to the sacrifice that I think is necessary for us to achieve these goals... or at least... the sacrifice I need to do in order to achieve these goals.",8,2,0.58,millenials,17,Tuesday,Night

16isomh,2023-09-14 20:17:30,What do you think about Joe Rogan?,"As a millennial , Joe Rogan was a big part of my life in formative years. When I was teen, I loved Fear Factor it was probably my favorite show and I loved Rogan. I would record episodes on VHS and watch bug eating challenges going to sleep.


And then for the podcast, I listened pretty regularly into the early to mid 2010s. I sopped listening after getting bored of it. Never really got into his MMA commentating though.

However, I really have been noticing Joe Rogan getting A LOT of negative media attention which I think is unwarranted. Yes, he's not a medical expert you should trust, he's just a pot smoking fihter that you listen to in the background when trying to kill time on a long drive or doing chores, or taking a walk.


I don't believe the negative attention is warranted, and  Idon't understand the exorbitantly high standards the general population is putting on him just for having a large podcast.",22,0,0.47,millenials,7,Thursday,Evening

However, I find it difficult as many Millenials get triggered so easily. My first observation is that friendship bonding is based upon whatever ""trauma"" or issues that you experienced in your life. I'm not use to this. However, I also noticed that you get ""triggered"" easily.  For example, I made a friend who's roommate is non-binary and they go by ""them/they"" and I said that's the hardest pronoun grouping that I have troubled with and this seemed to have upset him as he's very close to his roommate. There are often times he's overwhelmed and only wants to text not talk on the phone. He's cancelled on many occasions because he's overwhelmed (new school, move/cat died). Also, they are highly political to date, for example, I had a date and he didn't want to date me anymore because I like Dave Chappelle.",20,0,0.29,millenials,13,Tuesday,Evening

15xfin2,2023-08-21 18:19:18,Four years into my career and I am a glorified personal assistant,"I have been in HR for the last 4 years. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. I’ve worked with small companies to large international corporations. I’ve done general HR and specialized in Talent Acquisition. I am a good worker. I always give 100% even when I only have 70% to give. I have countless recommendations on my LinkedIn account telling that story. 

And yet, I have been searching for a role in Talent Acquisition since last September unsuccessfully. Initially, I did get a few interviews and even made it to the final rounds of several. These days? I get a decline email if I am lucky. 

What my resume doesn’t tell you is that I have been a victim of circumstances. I am not a serial job hopper. I want to find my place in society, have stability. Since starting my career in HR, I have been forced to take contract after contract. Always with the dangling carrot of being brought on full-time. My first contract was extended once, with the promise that they would make me FT at the end of it. That didn’t happen, but you know what did? COVID. Bye-bye job security. Hello existential dread. 

I tried to keep myself busy and thankfully was able to launch an art business. While it did allow me to have some cashflow again, this was not my chosen career. Art is a hobby. I truly thrive when collaborating with a team, making a real impact to peoples lives. 

I finally caught a break at the start of 2021. I was hired once more for a short-term contract. I was put in an environment of sink or swim with little to no guidance. But I persevered and showed them my worth. I grew within the company, receiving two promotions within my eight-month tenure. Those who shine brightest will eventually burn out. And that it exactly what happened. I gave too much of myself to this role. I would work every weekend, always stay late and yet my compensation did not reflect that. I was earning 42K as a highly educated individual, with years of experience at this point. It wasn’t fair. I deserved better. So, I sought better.

Thinking I finally found it, my forever home, a place to grow professionally and flourish. Who cares if to get it I would have to do a long-term contract? Who needs health care. I will put my head down and do my best again; learn the company culture again; join a new team again. This was my 5th team in two years, having to prove myself yet again. And did I! I was thrown in yet again into the chaos, but this time I had support; this time I was able to do it with the help of an amazing colleague and manager. 

A new year began, and I was asked to join them full-time. My heart sang! Until I kept reading and realized they wanted me to take a 11K pay cut. I spent a month negotiating. I found out that they were planning to pay me the lowest salary in the allotted salary band for the role. I wondered; how can this make any sense? They’ve seen what I am capable of. They know that I am capable and have years of experience in the field. Why would they think I deserve the bare minimum? 

I said no. I was taken advantage of too many times in the past. I had been working in the professional space for over 7 years at this point having had a past in administration. I’ve paid my dues. I’ve done the grunt work; I’ve proved myself time and time again. I deserved more than the bare minimum. 

We ended the negotiation with the promise that my offer still stands and that we would revisit compensation in the mid-year review. Mid-year came along with many changes to the company structure. When I was brought on, the market was booming, and this company like many others, over hired. The easiest way to reduce over staffing is to let the contacts expire. 

I was offered a short-term contract extension to train my replacement, an amazing talent that was ready to be moved from a support position into an individual contributor. I am not proud of my decision. I know I should have stayed but there was an injustice in staying that I could not swallow. Why should I stay here and train my replacement when at the end of the year when Christmas comes around, I will be job less? This company is not looking out for my best interest, why should I look out for theirs? Not my finest moment, but it was a human moment. 

So, I spent the next eight months on the market. A Sahara dry desert of market. Many companies were dealing with the same thing, trying to balance out the over hiring. The market was flooded with incredible talent. No one was hiring for people to hire people when lay-offs are happening everywhere. 

Beaten by my experience, I lowered the bar and allowed myself to take a position that would not help my grow in my career. A position with an empty title and filled with indignities. I was an HR manager in name alone. Realistically, I was treated as glorified personal assistant. Normally, I wouldn’t have stuck around. But I got this job through a personal connection, and it was not just my reputation on the line. So, I have sucked it up and watched myself loose a myself piece by piece. I am no longer that eager go getter. And I am sad. 

I am sad for the woman I once was. I am sad that I have given so much of myself to all these companies and have only been left with a feeling of defeat. I prided myself on my accomplishments, stood up for myself after many injustices. Where did that leave me? Getting asked to search someone else’s email account for a phone number because they deem their time more valuable than mine. Getting asked to find a lease for their girlfriend’s vehicle because it doesn’t matter what I’ve accomplished in life before, this is where I am now. 

I have tried to remain positive. I’ve been applying and applying and on a good day, I receive a decline email. But mostly these applications and referrals end in me getting ghosted. This is the reality of a millennial who tried to launch their career as the pandemic hit. I get to get up each day, loose a bit more of myself, in order to make a “living” – a living where I can’t afford to move out of my parents’ home. I am barely surviving.
