1ccwkzr,2024-04-25 16:36:49,Going through a midlife crisis,"I have been realizing recently that I am going through a midlife crisis. Three weeks ago, things weren't bad, but it all went to shit after going through a second round of layoffs in one year. I survived it, but started to feel disillusioned. I feel negative about everything.

My partner and I had been looking at homes and discussed living in the state we are at and he told me that he would have everything he wanted. It got me realizing that I didn't have anything I wanted. My entire life I gave up something.

I took care of my family and never had time to make friends, I took care of two ex's while crawling through school. I gave up dreams to travel, to live somewhere new, to study abroad, to work abroad, to work in the field I wanted. I had so little autonomy to myself and I went through life on a team for one.

I am wracked with not knowing what I want. Would it be better to settle in the state and city I grew up in even if I always felt there was something better? Am I just saddened by the place because I have friends, but no friendship circle? Am I feeling the isolation because I work from home? But if I stop working from home then I would have to brave our traffic and I have such bad driving anxiety and our roads are getting worse. Would I experience the spontaneity I so desire if I moved to a more bustling place? Would I even like it? Would it be too cold or too hot? Would I die not knowing how to live in those climates? What if I move and hate it? What about global warming? What if I choose a place affected by global warming? Would my partner even move with me at this point since they are upset with me for how I have been acting? Am I just not finding the right events to go to? Do people my age just not have interest in these types of events? Is everyone just too outdoorsy for me? Should I settle down or should I travel? Will houses get more expensive the more time I am wasting -- they are already expensive now?

If I settle down here, what if laws get worse? What if the elections go poorly? What if I get sick and lose the house and can't afford to cover myself and then think if only I had moved abroad? Would it be a good idea to throw away my safety net?

Should I move abroad? Would moving abroad help? I still have to learn the language. Would I have community or would it be too late? It would be not car-centric, but would that be enough to like it? Would it fit in?

  
The feelings won't go away. For awhile, I was able to tell myself I was happy with what I had because I had gone through worse. Now, that my job is remote and I could travel (never been outside the US and only been outside of my state once in the last sixteen years and barely to other cities), I feel like I could travel, but I am locked down by my partner and my own fears. At this point, with how back and forth I have been, I will probably lose my partner and then have to face all of this alone.",47,25,0.9,millenials,5,Thursday,Afternoon
1cbwkmb,2024-04-24 12:12:05,It's funny how get a degree in anything has turned into why'd you get that stupid degree,"Had an interesting thought this morning. Obviously today we hear a lot of talk about why'd you get a degree in African Feminism of the 2000s or basket weaving or even a liberal arts degree. 

The irony is for older millenials especially but probably most millenials the advice, even more so than advice the warning was if you don't go to college you'll dig ditches or be a hobo. You could say you didn't know what you wanted to do or you don't think you're cut out for college and you'd be told it doesn't matter what you go for, you just need that piece of paper, it will open doors.

Today for sure but even probably a decade ago we had parents, teachers, mainstream media and just society as a whole saying things like whyd you go for a worthless degree, why didn't you look at future earning potential for that degree and this is generally coming from the same people who said just get that piece of paper, doesn't matter what its in.

I don't have college aged kids or kids coming of age so I dont know what the general sentiment is today but it seems millenials were the first generation who the ""just get a degree"" advice didn't work out for, the world has changed, worked for gen x, gen z not so much so millenials were kind of blindsided. Anyone going to college today however let alone in the past 5 or 10 years has seen their older siblings, neighbors maybe even parents spend 4 years of their life and tens of thousands of dollars with half of htem not even doing jobs that require degrees, another half that dropped out or didn't finish. It seems people are at the very least smartening up and not thinking college is just an automatic thing everyone should do.",2026,4972,0.86,millenials,17,Wednesday,Afternoon
1ccjb7c,2024-04-25 04:44:28,Does anyone else's parents get angry when you mention acknowledging your kid's fears and discomforts?,"For example, I have been separated from my son's mom for about 4 years, and currently live with my parents. My son is 6 and has been sleeping over at my house once or twice a week for a couple years now (the separation was hard on my kid so I agreed to have him sleep in one household until he got older). 

A few weeks ago, I decided it was time for him to start sleeping in his own room. I lay with him until he fell asleep, then went to my room and all was fine. Tonight, however, he told me that he just couldn't fall asleep after about half an hour and really wanted to just go to his mom's house to sleep. I double checked with him, suggested a couple things to help him relax, but in the end, that's what he wanted. So I called up his mom and she came and got him and we told him we were proud of him for letting me know his feelings. I hugged him goodnight and sent him on his way.

My parents flipped their shit. ""Why did you let him go back to his mom's, I don't understand, why didn't you just tell him to stop talking and go to sleep"" etc etc.

I found out from his mom later that he'd slipped a bit off the bed the last time he slept over and didn't feel as comfortable as he had sleeping with me in my big bed. So I went online and got a side rail to prevent that from happening. 

Cue my parents ""it's a bed, what's wrong with him? I slept in a bed the exact same size when I was 2 and was completely fine, he needs to learn to just not fall off when he's asleep, this is ridiculous""

Like... what? My kid is a little child, I don't expect him to need a side rail when he's 18 and leaves for college... but he is 6 and isn't comfortable even after my reassurance and talking, so it's my job to make him comfortable... he's not going to never sleep over again, it's literally 1 night. By me listening to him and giving him some control, I'm actually helping him trust me more and feel more comfortable and safe. 

But my parents just get so angry and defensive! They truly believe that they were perfect parents and anything I do differently is a direct, personal attack on them. It's really annoying...",29,73,0.97,millenials,15,Thursday,Night

I mean, do any of you feel like for your entire life, nothing has mattered, nobody has really cared about you, and that 100% of the time the blame falls on you, whether you were involved in something or not?  
  
This is the case with me. I'm in the middle of millennials, I suppose. I'm \~35yo, no college degree, no real experience outside of a very niche industry which I can't compete in anymore, and no end in sight. My mother has saved me, financially, after being laid off numerous times in the past few years. That said, it's still difficult because she is not shy at all about letting me know how much of a financial burden I've been, and I don't discount that, but it certainly isn't helping me get on my feet. If anything, it's leading me further down the hole of ""Well great... not only have I messed up my own life, but I am messing up my mother's life as well..."" and makes me feel more worthless, less deserving of life, less deserving of love, etc knowing that I don't know what to do.  
  
I have a psychiatrist and therapist, both of whom I've been seeing for years now. They really don't help. I live in a red state in a smaller town, and so options are not plentiful, nor are second opinions. I have been diagnosed with panic disorder w/agoraphobia and that means basically ""here take xanax.."". Of course I am on regular anti-depressants as well, but it does nothing. All medical professionals tell me the same exact line: ""medication will not fix your situation"". Well... obviously.. so why am I here? I can't fix my situation, so I tried to get help coping with it. That doesn't work apparently, and the root of all mental illness according to them is situations.

Anyway, I did not mean for this to turn into a post about depressive disorders, but more I want to know: Do any of you feel like, for your entire life, you have been doomed in some way? People not believing you, people assuming the worst about you constantly, people looking to crucify you for your shortcomings, but not offering any guidance to fix them, etc.. Like you are a nobody because of your generation. Invisible except to an accountant somewhere that sees you as an AGI vs Expenditure statement.

Fastforward 10 years and its the 2019-2020 school year, i lost all and any inspiration i had to be a teacher so i started looking around for other work and it was hard getting anything that paid decently with 10 years of education on my resume. A relative referred me to a job he used to work at for our local government, i got in and really ended up enjoying the work, and with the amount of optional OT i am given, (lately i am working 6 days a week) I almost doubled my salary. The thing is when i decided I wanted to leave the education sector. I sought out a career counselor and thru my two sessions with her, she felt nursing would be a sector i can excel at based on what information she gathered about me. So i went for it, I took about a years worth of pre-requistes, stayed up late studying and doing homework. Then I  Applied for the program. Got accepted and placed on a wait list. Waited two years and finally got notice i am to start in the fall of 2024. I would essentially have to quit my current job to go to school. I am 35, im on pace to make 120k at my civics job. I don’t want to let this job go because i really enjoy it and the pay is not bad at all. But i also feel that i don’t want to let all that work I did to get accepted and go into a nursing program go to waste. What would you guys do?

1cbsto1,2024-04-24 08:10:29,Feeling depressed after having kids,"Spouse and I are in late 30s and are first gen immigrants. We have three beautiful kids, good tech jobs, good savings, home in a vhcol with low mortgage. We also have citizenship. Unfortunately we don’t have family here and friends circle keeps changing because people keep moving in and out of our VHCOL area and there is no stability in social life. It feels like its only us here and everything else is superficial and no one would care if anything happened to any of us. We are just not happy. Parents and inlaws are in India and pressure us to move back or atleast tell our future plans.

We were sure we want to be here because kids love it here and things were good. But the recent waves of tech layoffs has us worried. In this country, no job equals lots of issues (no healthcare, lot of expenses that can’t be stopped). So we planned to move back home but it is very very depressing to go back. Spouse hates it there and wants us to fight and stay and doesn’t think its a big deal not to have anyone as a close circle. They would love to have the circle but are not bothered much if it is not there. They feel almost everyone in US that moves away from family lives like this and our situation is not unique. They are open to moving anywhere in US but wants to move to India only as a last option.

I want to make sure my kids and spouse are taken care of in case anything happens to me. Not worried about finances but very worried about social support. Very depressed thinking of my kids. I don’t know what to do and with layoff talk, its harder to justify being here if there is no job to hold us here. What should I do? Stay here and keep looking for jobs? Move back home, spend more time with parents and inlaws, have more people around who will help us if we are in a bind and deal with spouse probably hating the life there? Or should we move to somewhere else inside US and reset our lives there?

I can't help but look back and almost feel a sense of betrayal, but that seems almost too harsh of a way to describe it. The social and economic damage that my parents generation did absolutely derailed us from what I have gathered. I don't blame them, but at the same time I just can't believe a whole generation would be so careless to live as though there would never be a reason to worry about tomorrow. 

The general impression I got was as children, so many of my friends were sold this promise that it would be even better for us than it was for our parents, our parents who had it so well growing up when they did, and because of all that they did in their time it would be even better for us. It was almost as though we were told to dream bigger than anyone else- only for everything to fall apart in front of us before we truly understood what happened.

1cba62d,2024-04-23 17:15:47,I regret going to college & this is why.,"Story time. 

Please be kind :) 

I did okay my freshmen year in high school, but I nearly flunked out my sophomore year. Somehow my mom could tell I needed a change of pace so she enrolled me into an early college program with only 100 students with a smaller teacher-student ratio. An early college high school program means that you can take community college courses (not AP) for free alongside your high school courses. I started doing better in my classes, but I thrived in my college courses. Since I was doing well at the community college, I decided to stay home after graduation and continue my enrollment. I could decide if I wanted to transfer to a 4 year college later. I also planned to take a semester off because I was burned out, and honestly depressed. 

Anyway, I used to go to church and I had older millennial youth pastors as my mentors (I was 19 and they were only in their upper 20s). They started asking all the seniors what our plans were for college. Anyone who said ""gap year"" or ""no college"" was lectured. I told them: ""I'm going to take a semester off before continuing at community college."" My mentor starts aggressively pushing a 4 year college and no breaks. ""You have to go to a 4 year college. And most people who take a gap year never go back. You have to go to college."" Looking back, they were clearly parroting exactly what their boomer parents always told them. 

Never mind, I didn't have the good enough grades for college yet nor the money. My parents were not forcing me to go to college right away and my single mom hadn't saved a penny for me to go, therefore I had to take out student loans for all 4 years. I also had no plan for what I would do with my degree (Journalism, then I switched to Political Science to graduate on time) and naively expected that all manner of entry level jobs would be available since that's what we were told. I had no business going to uni (due to my grades, mental health, and lack of a plan to pay my loans back). 

I did eventually find a college that accepted my GPA, got my grades up, then transferred to a nicer school. But because I didn't take any time off, I actually ended up super depressed and burned out when I finally graduated. I unintentionally took a break from working (in food service) because I moved cities with my partner at the time. While job hunting, I started to discover that I'm naturally good at freelancing in creative work, which doesn't require a 4 year degree. 

I will always wonder what would have happened if: 1. I took the time off I needed to think about what degree (or path) that was worthwhile. 2. I went to community college so I wouldn't have had to take out higher student loans. It still irks the heck out of me that these mentors (while well-intended) misguided me so much. I'm not a victim and I know hindsight is 20/20. But not ""everyone"" needed to go to college back then. **I'm not anti-college at all, I just wasn't ready.** I even went back to school 7 years later in a field I'm actually good at and I had a much better experience. 

**TL;DR: I regret going to college because I was given misguided advice that I had to go by people who were not even my parents. I feel like I made a solid ""adult"" plan based on my income and GPA but it wasn't good enough for my mentors. Taking their advice somewhat set me back because if I had to do it all over again, I would have went to community college, got a job while staying at home, and started my own business ages ago. I would have saved thousands.** ",23,23,0.78,millenials,9,Tuesday,Evening

1cai9rn,2024-04-22 18:29:41,Reasons Gen Z'ers Don't Drink?,"As a millenial drinking culture was big in high school and college but surprisingly for Gen Z it isn't. This is talked about a lot and generally agreed to be a healthy choice and a positive thing and I think it is ie less DUI's, drinking isn't necessarily horrible for you in moderation but probably isn't the healthiest of activities. In some ways the lack of the community and socializing that comes with drinking could probably even be seen as a negative.

I see this mentioned a lot but never really see reasons given, I was thinking about this while driving today and came up with 3 reasons why Gen Z doesn't drink...

Phone Cameras
Back when I was in HS and college there were no cameras on phones. Worst case scenario you had to worry about someone taking a blurry throwaway camera pic of you. There were plenty of mornings I woke up with a traffic cone in bed with me, missing a shoe and aside from wondering oh man did I do something stupid anything would be pretty quickly forgotten. Today with cellphone cameras and even more so social media one bad decision lives forever. I do wonder if young people are wise/mature enough to realize this but it could be a reason.

Cancel Culture
Today people really need to walk on tiptoes, say one bad thing whether you misspeak, said in jest or maybe even say something nasty while drunk but in todays world saying one wrong thing can lose you friends and get you cancelled. I think in all areas of life we tread much more carefully in regards to what we say, this could also be a reason.

Less Connection
The last reason I think is probably the one most people assume is the case which is just that younger people are less social, people today report having less friends than people of a similar age in the past, people report being lonelier, less people are involved in sports teams and organized activities and more people just play video games at home, even those with friends often engage with them on xbox live or social media.

1ccbkrg,2024-04-24 22:26:22,About to go get a cashier check for 20% down for my fourth house in Cash closing tomorrow. Under 30. First Gen Immigrant. Came here without knowing any English. 29 years old. Life maybe hard but just keep grinding. Context in the post.,"Came here when I was 16 as an International Student by myself without any family, without speaking any English. Taught myself English through reading Mangas and attending free ESL classes at night in community college and working 2 jobs while in highschool 

I have 2.0 GPA when I graduate cause school never for me. Went to Community school with FAFSA and save up whatever money I have from working and going to community college to buy a fixer upper at 19 for $50k in the ghetto in cash and fix it up myself over a period of 14 months.

Use my FHA 3% down to buy a duplex and house back for 2 years and rent the other unit out while I go and live in my truck for the next 2 years while finishing my degree. Graduated in 2018 with Bachelor in Business and made connections with the frat bros to have them have their daddy hook me up with a job at the local investment firm 

Leverage the duplex and my SFH to get a refinance loan during the low rates COVID years and locked in 2.25% rate for my third SFH house. Renting out to section 8 right now. Duplex's and the SFH in the ghetto are fully paid off and had tripled in values, this third one I have 50% equity in

Made VP partner in 2022 after 4 years of working 80-100 hours a week 50 weeks year round and now I'm chilling barely work 10 hours a week while getting 6 figures salary and a bunch of wayyy smarter people work for me. I am content and will ride this out coastFIRE style till I'm 65. 

Tomorrow I am going to the bank to buy a cashier check for 20% down on my fourth rental house and I plan to get my fifth house by 33 hopefully when rate go down.

I posted this to say that yes, life is unfair and not anyone can grind to the top but if me a first Gen immigrant with zero English can get to where I am y'all can too. You got this. Not everything is doom and gloom.

Life in America is easy mode tbh I'd never get a chance to climb this high if I didn't leave my third world shit hole of a country

1cb6szs,2024-04-23 15:00:27,Millennial Movie Maker,"This is either going to make a lot of sense to post in here or no sense at all. Does anyone remember when we were young making and editing videos was really simple with Windows Movie Maker? 

Windows movie maker was built in video editing software that was very simple to use. It was a matter of dragging and dropping pictures or video files and cutting and editing them to a timeline. This feature came with computers, came with transitions and effects, came with sound effects, and if you had a microphone the ability to dub over top as well as add music you ripped from CD’s (or downloaded from lime wire).

I’ve bought three laptops in the last ten years and not one of them comes with editing software that comes even close to the simplicity of Windows Movie Maker, has near the amount of features as Windows Movie Maker, and is completely free like Windows Movie Maker. 

I have numerous videos with my family saved in my phone taking up so much space that I decided I would try downloading a movie making app so as to offload some of my storage and put my family trips on YouTube like I used to do when I was a kid. 

Every app for video editing (at least as far as I’ve seen) is not free. It’s not even available for purchase. It’s available via subscription, and if you don’t want to pay a subscription, you get the “free” version that includes no features and huge ugly watermarks. 

I was at work and I finally felt like a boomer talking about this problem with younger staff because they wanted to help me “problem solve” by showing me how I could start paying a subscription and adapting to a very clunky and complicated interface. That’s not the issue. The very app should be free and should be extremely easy to use. 

There was a time in life where video editing was extremely simple, included as a feature of the hardware you purchased, and it didn’t take hours of your life to figure out. When I was a kid I made so many movies, vlogs, and comedy sketches with my friends and it was really simple with a no bullshit interface. 

I can’t tell if I’m old or if they’re over complicating apps so as to make them seem “professional” so consumers can justify to themselves paying for something that should be free. When my sister would make video blogs for MySpace or my brother would make skateboard videos to CKY I’d always help and it would be free and easy.

So they stay home even if their family life isn’t the best. Its still a luxury i do not have.

1c9sg2j,2024-04-21 20:54:58,How are you feeling about self-driving cars & automation? ,"Last year in Phoenix I had the privilege of hailing a ride with Waymo from their app. It is a self-driving taxi cab company. It picked me up from my hotel and I rode in the passenger seat for 20 minutes from to a restaurant for dinner. Seeing the car drive itself on public roads was wild. The only time I had a  surprise was when the car took a right hand turn at a red light. I was not expecting it, but it was legal and there was no oncoming traffic.

I wondered what I was feeling was experienced by our parents and grandparents? The first time they saw a color televisions, or turned on a computer, or perhaps flew across an ocean to visit a different country.

Has anyone else been able to experience hailing a self-driving car yet? How did it make you feel, or how do you think you'll react when you get the chance?

Do you think we Millennials will stop driving ourselves around someday? Do you like driving?

Is your job or anyone else you know threatened by cars and trucks being able to drive themselves? What are you going to do when the day arrives that you're automated out of the job?

Apparently Waymo and Cruise will have self-driving cars on the road in SF, LA, Phoenix and Austin by the end of the year.

1c8nbgc,2024-04-20 11:04:46,"If capitalism truly is the ""end of history"", then I am completely ok with the idea that humanity will die to climate change","
When I was 11 or 12 during the housing crisis, I lived with my disabled mom in a tent in Ocala National Forest for 6 months terrified that id get eaten by bears. This core memory would stimulate my lifelong interest in finding the nuances in the answer to the question ""if I live in the richest country in the world, why did me and my mom have to live in the woods?""

Earlier today I was watching something where the main character is 17. Idrk how to explain it but something about what I was watching made me realize that my current 29 year old self would have nothing but warnings for my 17 year old self. if I were to talk to them, I'd have absolutely no genuine hope to offer. My entire 20s has just been struggle after struggle and I've never had any time at all to just breathe. No semblance of hope for my financial security at all. My borderline personality disorder makes getting through even the 4 day work week I've limited myself to completely miserable. Most of the time I don't even want to be around or observed by people let alone serving the public in a way that only enriches the business owner I work for. 

It has never felt worth it to me. There isn't even a philosophical carrot for me to chase. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live to serve the rich either. The only reason I even care about money is for necessities. I've never had a single thought along the lines ""I think I'd like to work a bit harder and maybe put in some overtime so I can afford x thing"". Working to enrich someone else is so miserable to me that every single possible second I can afford to spend not doing it, I'm going to. There ain't a damn luxury thing money can buy to me that's worth more to me than freedom away from work. Even if there was I couldn't afford it anyway.

I know this is going to sound like I'm some contrarian edgelord, but it gives me these intrusive thoughts that the only option I could live with is fighting and dying in a revolution. I'm not here to make any political debates one way or another, but from a personal mental health standpoint and my own core personality-forming experiences, I don't think I can keep living with myself in an environment that rewards sociopathic behavior in a competition for artificially scarce resources. 

I'm tired boss. I'm so drained from all of the financial hardship and losses in my life that I don't even want to play anymore. I don't really care about anything anymore except my disdain for American culture and Capitalism. I used to be a curious, engaged, friendly, open minded person with all kinds of non political interests, and now all I have left is hate. I don't want to be this way. 

Meanwhile society is still just as polite as ever to the socioeconomic class of people who generate their huge amounts of wealth simply by owning things at the expense of those who don't own things. If I ever met a billionaire in person I'd probably spit on them. It is not humanly possible for a single person to work enough to earn 1 billion $. That fortune should have never belonged to them, it should belong to the workers who actually created the value. Just because they followed the law doesn't abdicate them of guilt and immorality. I wish more people would shame them.

I read an article the other day that said 44% of all US workers make less than 20k$ a year. That article is here: https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/12/03/42166145/what-60-minutes-missed-44-of-us-workers-earn-18000-per-year 

Not only are we struggling so hard, the media won't even admit it.


I guess to wrap up ill circle back around to the title. I'm not saying climate change is something we should ignore, I'm just saying for me personally I don't even have the capacity to care as long as my socioeconomic heirarchy of needs aren't being addressed. I might feel differently if I had a kid, but a main reason I don't want kids is because I don't want them to suffer through this shit like I've had to. The sooner the world ends the less people will have to suffer for the greed of the few. Also reminding whoever reads this that I'm not here to make any political debates and won't respond to any trolling.

1c9ucte,2024-04-21 22:13:37,Struggling... Feeling like I'm stuck,"I feel like I'm behind my peers. And I feel like it's from a life long lack of self confidence and lack of motivation.
I was a gifted student in school. Very shy, a few close friends that I still am close to today. Raised Southern Baptist, very involved in church. Didn't have my first boyfriend until 18yo. Didn't ever work a job (basically because I was scared of people and failure) aside from being our Children's pastors intern my senior year and babysitting.

Graduated high school, went to a University where I declared an elementary education major. Then changed it to undeclared because basically I was scared of being observed teaching. I really don't like any attention on myself, it makes me super self conscious.

So I floated around majors for a while, toyed with the idea of going home and going to a community college. But I was raised super sheltered and had a taste of being on my own, and couldn't fathom going back. Plus I had actually met a group of friends, and I had never really had a solid group of friends up until that point.
Science and math seemed too hard so I declared Criminal Justice as my major. Just wanted to pick something so I could stay at the school and not go home.

Really have always enjoyed Spanish, took several classes in high school and took 3 upper level Spanish in college, but didn't make it my major because I was scared to study abroad.. Also didn't know what I would do with that major besides teach, which I thought I didn't want to do.

I met my husband my junior year of college. We were in the same friend group. He was and is the best thing that ever happened to me. But I was still  so sheltered and naiive and I just knew he would take care of me and I wouldn't have to support myself so it made it even easier for me to shy away from doing anything on my own.

We got married a few months after I graduated, and we moved to Kansas. He had an uncle there who offrred him a job, and I was able to find one in a courthouse as a deputy court clerk. 

We planned to stay there for about 4 years, then have kids. But I'm awful about taking medication correctly (bc) and we found out that we were expecting our first daughter 7 months after we got married. About 5 months after moving to KS.

I was so worried about being so far from my mother and having a baby. He was willing to stay and do it on our own, but I pretty much forced us to come home. We found him a job in the town my parents live in, and we moved back 9 months after moving out there.
Our oldest daughter was born. And we struggled because I couldn't really work very much. We accumulated debt fast. It was stressful. 
Eventually, I worked at a non-profit domestic violence shelter as a legal advocate. I loved that job and I was pretty good at it.

Then, when our oldest was 6mo old, we found out we were expecting #2... It was just a lot.

We lived with my parents for a while. That was a struggle. I began to realize what a co-dependent relationship I had with them.. Mainly my mom.
We had our second daughter, moved into our own home that we purchased. Money was still so tight. Still accumulating debt. Credit cards.. Ect. Looking back now I really purchased stupid shit, usually thinking we needed it or that it would make life easier.. But interest was eating us alive. I had quit my job at the non-profit because my mom couldn't keep my girls 5 days a week all day.

I worked as a substitute teacher, about 3 days a week. My mom kept my girls.

We had always wanted to move back to where my husband was from, close to where we went to college. When our youngest daughter was about 1.5yo he was offered a job that would allow us to move back, so we did.

We didn't have anyone to watch the girls though in our new town, so I couldn't work. Childcare is very limited here and expensive.
My husband worked so hard. Long hours. But we still weren't able to shake our debt. And it had grown even more by this point.
Did that for a few years.

We have a nice house, it's small but it's all we need, an acre and a half, plenty of space for the girls to play. We have a nice truck and my car isn't as nice but it is paid off. We just have a lot of debt, I've been able to negotiate lower interest rates in a lot of it, so that's good. But we have a home equity line of credit with $49 on it... 
Now our daughters are both in school. I was faced with finally having the opportunity to say ""What do I want to do?"" There aren't any court jobs. I just ended up substitute teaching again because it gives me a flexible schedule to be able to be with my girls. I was offered a parapro position at their school, and I took it. I only make $13/hr. And the benefits stink to be honest. I love my job and the kids but I know I'm capable of more..

My parents recently moved close to us, and my in laws live next door now.

They've asked me about teaching. I have a bachelors degree, just not in education. So id have to get my masters, or go through the county for licensure. I just am back to those feelings of fear and inadequacy. Being scared that I'd fail. Scared of having to deal with parents. There's so much that is on teachers these days. 
Also relevant is that I was diagnosed ADHD a few years ago. It gave me so many answers to struggles I've always had. I'm so forgetful, it's like my memory is 30 seconds sometimes. I lose things constantly. I get very overwhelmed when there's a lot going on. I binge eat sugar, I guess it's a dopamine seeking thing. I'm not on any adhd meds. I tried an antidepressant that helped for a few months then seemed to not help anymore. I can't afford therapy of any kind really.

I already feel like I'm drowning between being a wife, mom, and working my current job, and keeping up with my house. But we're in such debt. We can pay our bills, but we can't save. And we can't pay anything off. We'd have so much extra money if we didn't have debt. I'm just so tired. I don't know what to do. If you've read this far you're an angel, seriously. Tell me what you think, give it to me straight..

[https://youtu.be/zUF3qbAD-Qw?si=6O9vFLGCb6xeERLa](https://youtu.be/zUF3qbAD-Qw?si=6O9vFLGCb6xeERLa)

Back then, we were encouraged to embrace humor, even when it was at our own expense. We understood that a joke, even a sharp one, was just that—a joke. However, the climate has shifted significantly. What was once seen as light-hearted teasing is now often perceived as a personal attack, a manifestation of toxic behavior. This raises a poignant question: does our current sensitivity contribute to the deteriorating mental health among our youth?

You see, it seems to me that our generation, and the generations before us, were inculcated with a certain resilience. We were taught to have thick skin, to laugh at ourselves. This wasn't just about being tough; it was a form of freedom. Freedom to express, to air grievances, and ultimately, to understand and forgive. There was a certain grace in how we handled criticism and conflict.

Now, let's be clear: I believe it is vital to respect and protect each individual's dignity. But in our quest for a more respectful society, have we swung too far to one side? Have we, in our effort to avoid causing offense, limited our ability to communicate honestly? This culture of shame and intolerance for differing viewpoints does not facilitate understanding. Rather, it fosters a society where people merely tolerate each other, avoiding the true engagement that builds genuine connections.

It's a delicate balance, one that requires us to navigate the fine line between sensitivity and censorship. How do we maintain our authenticity while still respecting the boundaries of others? This is not an easy task. As leaders, as friends, as family members, we must strive to understand and be understood, knowing full well that it is impossible to please everyone. But it is through this challenging discourse that we find progress, not by silencing voices but by enriching the conversation. Let's not shy away from this challenge; let's embrace it and move forward together.",26,0,0.5,millenials,17,Sunday,Afternoon

On Doordash it showed $95. When i walked in to pick up the total was $80. I thought they missed something. But no it was cheaper cause I called. 

I speak Cantonese so I can converse with the restaurant easily. I was speaking with the front of house when I picked up. I apologized for not using online ordering. She told me it’s ok just call in. It’s cheaper. They also don’t make any extra money on door dash. It’s just more expensive to cover door dash fees.

I appreciate door dash because there’s a lot of resteraunts people don’t visit because of language barrier.

I (23) want some insights as to how people managed to be able to afford to ""lie flat"" financially? 

Lying flat is where one rejects the culture of overworking, while doing the absolute bare minimum to survive. 

The reason behind why I asked this question is because I see no future in being forced to work tirelessly for 30+ years and sucking up to the corporate world. 

I would like to ideally work for 10-15 years, while saving and investing to the point that I can afford to  BaristaFIRE (where I can work low-stress jobs or pursue interests for a living). 

My long-term goal is to potentially own a very small townhome/villa in a low COL area in Australia (anywhere), and eventually ""lie flat"", obviously while still working, so I have the freedom to not be forced to continue the corporate rat race for my entire life. I honestly just don't see myself working until past the age of 60 in corporate.

Some of you have mentioned that you don’t have kids or cannot afford them. Kids are not for everyone and they are indeed expensive. This question was geared towards those that either have kids or have already started preparing education expenses in anticipation of having kids.

There’s a number of you that have mentioned “don’t have kids if you can’t afford them” and similar comments. I find this very naive and narrow minded. You assume that anyone who has kids and is struggling automatically started off struggling and randomly decided to throw kids in the mix for shits and giggles. Life happens.

1. When you tip before you get your food your service could be horrible and there’s nothing you can do because you have already tipped. You are no longer rewarding good service.
2. The customer feels obligated to tip more than usually for fear that the staff may mess with the customer’s food if the tip is too low. 

I feel that requiring you tip before your service is complete should be illegal as it makes an optional payment obligatory through coercion.

I know that customer service workers don’t make much and their job is super hard but it’s ridiculous to put this on the customer. Also if I’m the one picking up my food, why am I expected to tip? I was a waitress and bartender for 10 years and  always tip generously but it’s now getting nuts.

One thing that sticks out to me is many people seem to miss community. Someone in a similar post the other day made a comment that really stuck with me, they said that a lot of the community we had as kids was there because adults in our life had made the connections and taken the time and energy to create it for us.

This could be any number of things but a lot of my fondest memories as a kid are hanging out with other neighborhood kids during a block party or while our parents and the neighbors hungout in the driveway having a few beers. I remember my parents would hangout with some of our neighbors and drag us kids along and I'd play with my parents friends kids, maybe one of the older kids would let me play his nintendo, I remember hanging out late watching star search of all things with these kids. I have a lot of good memories like of simple things like that but just remember feeling a sense of community.

Like this person pointed out in the post the other day, these things didn't just come together on their own. Now don't get me wrong I realize were not living in the same world we were as kids. People aren't as trusting of strangers, people aren't as open to meeting new people. I remember my dads employer used to have a company picknic, things like that don't really happen anymore so that community isn't going to be there by default as much as it was in the past but that doesn't mean we can't create it, but yeah it does take time and effort.

Thinking about this I can admit I kind of want this community but at the same time don't want to get out of my comfort zone or don't want to put in the effort to create it and I think that's true of many of us. Anyhow, just wanted to share this point, yeah in todays society you're going to have to work harder to create community, its not as much just built into life as it was in the 80s or 90s but even back then the reason a lot of us had community was because adults around us created it.

What does that mean? I suppose it means you have to make the effort to get to know your neighbors, say hi to people as your passing them on the street walking the dog around the neighborhood, etc. Again, people are less open to these things today I try to make an effort to give a hello to neighbors I pass walking the dog and many people will cross the street as to not have to talk to you or will look at the ground but I think these little things are how we create more of a sense of community",323,558,0.95,millenials,11,Tuesday,Morning

Every year I say to myself that I am going to take PTO during event week, but I never end up doing it. This year’s big event comes up the first week of May and I do not want to attend. What is a good excuse I can use? Getting sick that weekend seems a little bit too obvious. I hate that I even have to lie, but they always seem to hold it against anyone that can’t make it, regardless of their excuse.  ",4,2,1.0,millenials,5,Wednesday,Afternoon

1c5qjmm,2024-04-16 20:33:22, I'm satisfied and it feels good ,"Black male 38 veteran and I am satisfied with my life right now. I was born into a 2 parents house and one older sibling also I had ADD and was medicated like most of us at the time. I was a smart kid but my school didn't had the funding to help me excel at the time but I made the honor roll when I had the right teachers. Met my future wife online in 2004 and that was very weird for the time unlike now lol. I joined the navy right after highschool and was sent to Japan where I met my future wife face to face and spent Xmas together.
She was still a school girl in Japan and I couldn't see her all the time but I took time off to see her when I could.
         I traveled the world from Australia to Thailand and Malaysia. I danced in Tokyo and Yokohama and hung out with Japanese stars and met Michael Jackson, usher, trey Songz and Will Smith. I learned to speak Japanese to a decent level and got married to my wife and had our 1st on my deployment. I leave the navy and decide to spead more time with my family and move back to America and go back to school. Me and my wife have bumps here and there since we married in our early 20's and are just about as different as you can get but we make it.
        I move up through the US government and get a job back to Japan as a civilian so my wife can spend some time with her family but unknown to me and her is she is under heavy depression. We almost called it quits just before COVID but I always listened to what my pops told me before he died "" a man ruled by his emotions is dangerous but a man who understands his and other emotions is a true worth of a man"" so i listen more and we work it out. I move back to America after 5 years and I started looking for a house just like everyone here and it sucks. Before I even get on the plane my older cousin tells me that my grandmother is moving in with her and that semi new house that she lived in is mine. So now I have 1500sq ft  10 year old paid off house with 0.34 arce of land. I make my wife a garden in the back and build a patio and grill. Having a house that's paid off helped me start my savings to hit past 10k and then boom the VA tells me after years of telling me no that I will start getting paid for my disability. My 3 kids are in advance classes and I paid off my cars and my wife college debt.
        I write this sitting in my back yard as a cool breeze flow through the wind and I am happy. Do I think I am lucky? Hell yeah 😂 but my sister is doing better lol her husband $700,000 a year coaching at a D1 school but you would never be able to know and my cousin who passed to house to me is a professor at a LSU so our family is doing good but we don't brag since we still use coupons and look for sales lol. So I just wanted to say uncontempt with life I don't need a big mansion or a nice car I'm happy

I’m 10 years out of college and I’m still 10 years behind.
All the things I thought I’d have by now are still so out of sight.
And it doesn’t sit with me quite right, I’m 32 years into this life. 
I should have more W’s and L’s got so used to hell I don’t even feel the fire when it’s in my face

Settle down and fall in love wonder where Colin ended up

1c5s6hn,2024-04-16 21:39:59,Rant - every option seems like a scam,"This is a rant. If you don't want that energy, I understand. You might want to look elsewhere.

Why does it seem like every option is a scam?

Paying money to a landlord - I'm paying to cover someone else's mortgage, taxes, insurance and am, in reality, left to do most maintenance on the property (regardless of what the law says). And even if I leave that place in the condition that I found it I know I can inevitably look forward to fighting to get my deposit back.

Buying a property - With interest rates and the cost of housing these days, how is it even worth it? A small home in a medium COL city is probably going to cost you around $450k. Say you've somehow managed to save up $50k despite above landlord's best efforts. Using a basic mortgage calculator: you still end up with a $3500/mo payment including taxes and insurance. That doesn't take into account closing costs, recent regulatory changes which will make the buyer responsible for half the sales commission, and any up-front costs to fix the place up. That also doesn't include HOA fees. And then the banks are somehow allowed to front-load your interest. So in the first chunk of your loan you're only putting away a tiny amount of principle. Yet prices continue to go up while a lowering of interest rates is nowhere in sight. Somehow this hasn't led to a major economic collapse.

Inflation - Gas, groceries, healthcare, education, housing, childcare, transit, everything we need to survive keeps increasing in cost faster than our bosses are increasing our wages. You're given a ""raise"" at work that barely covers those increases (if you're lucky) and you're supposed to be happy about it. These prices go up due to mysterious forces like ""supply chain issues"" but once those issues are fixed the prices don't go back down. It doesn't matter how much harder you work, you get less and less for your effort.

Higher education - From expensive textbooks where you must buy a new online copy, to a pervasive shame around anything less than a four-year college, higher education has been made into another way for people to suck you dry. I think higher education is great and necessary. But the way we do it puts people into massive debt with minimal payoff. We take advantage of teenagers who don't know much about finances by telling them they must go to a four year school if they're going to ""amount"" to anything. Oh and if you really want to have a legacy, make sure that's a private four year school. High schoolers waste what little childhood they have left padding their CV with prerequisite classes or extracurriculars and cramming for standardized tests. Meanwhile all these awesome associates and trade programs exist that allow you to quickly learn at low cost and start making money as soon as possible. But they hardly get a mention. In other countries (like those in the EU) post-secondary education is almost free.

Healthcare - $700/mo for a $7000 deductible plan with numerous exemptions. Need I say more?

Civics - Climate change is in full swing, we're in constant conflict (or bankrolling it), our rights and safety net are slowly being stripped away, and even if you vote, write your congressperson, protest, do all the things, it doesn't seem to change one bit. At the very best all we can do is elect someone who might pump the brakes. And even things that seem like they might make a positive impact end up falling to pieces under closer inspection. For instance, the Infrastructure Rebuilding Act spends a lot of money on transitioning our infrastructure to use green energy. Except it also greatly [increases](https://www.manchin.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/ira_provisions_to_boost_oil_gas_production_and_decarbonization.pdf?cb) the amount of oil and gas leases on public land. The recently approved Willow Creek project may [outpace](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/13/alaska-willow-project-approved-oil-gas-biden) all the gains made by the IRA. And then we have the racial justice protests of 2020. There you had a massive nation-wide uprising. But what change did we really see? Biden [gave](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/01/fact-sheet-president-bidens-safer-america-plan-2/) $35B to law enforcement. Very little changed about policing in almost all localities. This after you had massive rights violations of journalists and protesters during that time. It seems like even a popular movement gets nothing done.

It feels like the entire social contract is broken and there's no way out. Like everything constantly becomes more and more of a struggle, and the finger is pointed at us to fix it, but all of it is so beyond our grasp to influence. And we're supposed to put a smile on every day and sweep it under the rug.",20,20,0.72,millenials,8,Tuesday,Night

But I'm also curious about things like virtual reality and augmented reality, and how they'll change the way we experience the world. And what about space exploration?

1c59lv6,2024-04-16 06:53:34,Running out of options for a viable life...,"So, a bit of a pity post. A long one at that. 

**The TLDR is 'I am in a hole, my life is too complicated to steer anymore, and my brain doesn't want to cooperate with any ideas to dig out of it.'**

The longer version, is 37m (British), with a bachelors in sort of STEM (Biology), which I graduated in **2008**. And then a math-based masters (Ag. Economics) which I graduated in **2020**. Yes, I have all the luck.

Clearly I am not neurotypical, with ADHD obvious from a young age, but increasingly hints of other complications (bipolar, schizo, autism, whatever, to add to GAD and depression) that have made holding jobs and staying in one direction long-term all but impossible.  \[Many have disputed this, and say I am neurotypical enough, so I am obviously high functioning at least\].  
\- Since I turned 18 the longest I have stayed in one country, let alone job, has been 3 years. My longest time with a single employer is probably 2 years, mostly I drive myself out of them within 6 months... despite showing promise, it starts to literally hurt my brain to remain in them.

I have been suicidal many times in my life, and have always just taken the 'well, make a radical change then... what do you have to lose?' philosophy, and that has injected novelty at the expense of building career capital. 

Last year it was more acute than normal, getting to the full planning and resourcing stage. I made big changes again. The business plan I wanted to do with a friend got cancelled due to political changes in that country, so I crashlanded in my last possible refuge... teaching TEFL in Asia. Something I pissed away my 20s doing, and spent the last 10 years trying to escape. Also, the last bastion of 'contact someone, show CV, get job, do simple paperwork, become a legal and functional member of said country'... exactly how it doesn't work anymore in OPEC countries (I spent 2 years trying to find work in Europe related to my field of study, no dice. Best described as kafkaesque).

But, one year further, and the complexity is increasing even more. I have restarted my life multiple times, and had to make decisions between which thing to pursue. Slipping down the trousers of time, I successfully avoided going into plumbing in the UK in 2015, or events there in 2017... in favour of this pointless degree.

I am now even older. My focus on academia has given me nothing but a 'fiduciary responsibility to the truth', which in the current age feels like a liability more than anything. Returning to the UK now feels completely untenable for a vast swathe of reasons; partly due to the last sentence, and partly due to the clear economic and political distress it is under.

I still have rights to live and work in a poor EU country, but cannot find work there. I can just sit there and burn through my savings whilst getting internet addicted. Albeit with a dog.

The country I am in now is wonderful, albeit sanitised and overly controlled, but they are very clear that I am only useful as an English teacher/math tutor, and the way they do it here is closer to management than teaching. It is horrendous. I have taught in a dozen countries, and this is by far the worst (as I had been warned 10 years ago, which is why I never came back then), and adding the electronic addiction that all kids have now to an exclusively elementary market... it's not viable even medium term. I have topped up my finances, and feel healthier, but I need to move on.

I have looked into many careers to try and pivot into. With my age and eclectic work history, I really do not look attractive. I would suit risk management, for instance, but gone are the days of just doing a course and getting an entry-level job to work up from.

Add to that the obvious wrecking ball of AI to the job market in the coming years, and almost anything whitecollar is looking risky. If you already have experience in it it might be ok, but starting out fresh now when the job cuts start to come? Seems a good way to piss away another 3 years and end up even worse off. I've done enough of that, thanks.

So now I am mulling over opening up an education business in Thailand, or going self-employed in events in Germany/England. It's clear that I need to be more in charge to have the motivation to make it work, and that both of these avenues would interest me. They will require some capital, which I have been saving, but they are on the surface good ideas that I could execute well.

The issue, of course, is the endless burocracy. All 3 ideas require almost constant fighting with immigration rules, and that would be the key risk of the idea failing. Getting slapped by the invisible mallet. Hell, even doing it in my home country requires paying punitive fees for domestic insurances that make the whole thing untenable.

I'm still trying. Get knocked down 87 times, get up 88. I'm still here. My work ethic is still good. I am a talented generalist, but I am just so. fucking. tired. It's like this Chinese 'lay down' movement. Just surrendering to fate. Enough attempts, thank you. 

I once heard that the root cause of most suicides is life complexity; that at some point, enough mistakes and bad decisions have added up to make continuation either untenable or deeply unpleasant.

But where are the fresh start options of last resort even?

\- Can't run off and join the circus. No more circuses.  
\- Can't run off and join temples/monastery. They are now run as experiences for profit.  
\- Can't run off and join the foreign legion. They are now HIGHLY selective.

It's a whinge/rant/pity post I know, but one I think a lot of people my age/generation can relate to. And maybe it's just the stress that is making my brain so mushy that I can't think my way out of it either, not because I am a mental. 

ps. I have also tried getting medical help for the issues. You'd be amazed how fruitless the multiple painful and expensive attempts have been, especially when what I basically need is to go somewhere with lower life stress/complexity and a healthier community/lifestyle. Chicken and egg...

pps. congratulations for making it to the end of my Ted talk. I appreciate your time.

This has been particularly frustrating around medicine, stigma around psychedelics and marijuana, and their inability to come to grips with their excessive greed. Seriously, no one needs two homes. On the other hand, they must be in a great deal of pain as a second home is a costly therapy.

I have no solutions. I would like to ask the boomers, what are you running from? Are you aware that excessive consumerism is a form of escapism?

I grew up in the middle of state forest land in South Central Pennsylvania. From around the mid 90s until some time in the 2000s, every fall, my home would become completely covered in ladybugs. I lived in a brick home that was partially built and then was finished later by a different company, and there were some flaws in it, aka entry points for bugs. Growing up in the woods already exposed our home to the occasional big spider, giant moth, praying mantis, etc. (at least there's no cockroaches in the woods though!) But when I tell you these Asian Lady Beetles covered my home, I'm not exaggerating. 

There were so many of them that multiple would fly into you when you were outside. You could see them in the air. They would gather literally by the thousands in the corners of the ceilings inside. Random beetles would be crawling around on your pillow or anywhere else. 

My dad was an alcoholic who worked a lot and didn't feel the need to do anything about them. Maybe there's nothing he could have really done anyways; I don't know. But I know vacuuming them up was almost pointless, because they'd be back by the end of the day or the next day.

They would bite you sometimes. It was just a pinch and only hurt for a second but was annoying AF. And when they died, they would stink really bad. You know how stink bugs smell? Well, for whatever reason I can't smell stink bugs at all, but I seem to be the only person who can smell ladybugs. Maybe I was just smelling their rotting carcuses, but I don't think so, because it was usually when I smashed or flicked one across the room that I would smell it most. I think they emit a stench when they're attacked as a defense mechanism or something. Apparently the reason they are red and spotted is to warn predators that they taste bad, so that tracks. 

To top off the trauma, the ladybugs also helped me realize I was a social class below some of my peers.  I was considered pretty, and was a good athlete, so I found myself trying to fit in with the group that we used to lovingly/hatingly call ""the preppy kids"" or ""the preps"", or the popular crowd. I wish I was cool enough to not be so desperate to fit in with them. I really faked it well for a while. They all had parents who were either educated or owned their own businesses. Their parents were probation officers, lawyers, restauranteers, etc. and my small but federally funded town was very cliquey. I was so naive and innocent. I invited my friends over to my house. I didn't have a mom and my alcoholic dad had his own welding business and was gone most of the day. He didn't clean much and never taught me to maintain my living space or even hygiene. I was kinda on my own and had to learn a lot of things the hard way via public humiliation. I cleaned my home to the best of my ability at 12yo and invited my popular preppy friends over. The ladybugs were there. Despite vacuuming them, they congregated in the corners of the ceilings by the end of the night, and the next morning there were thousands of ladybugs carcasses on the floor. 

They acted fine and nice about it at the time, then returned to school the next week telling everyone behind my back about how dirty my house was and how it was infested with bugs everywhere. I was mortified and so embarrassed. Their moms were taking them shopping on the weekends, they were in the ski club at school, getting highlights put in their hair, getting their nails done at the salon, and I should have known better that I didn't fit in with them. At the time it felt impossible to be both a star athlete and not hang out with the jocks and preps. I eventually quit sports and started hanging out with either the ""bad kids"" or the ""stoner kids"", and sometimes those 2 crowds mingled and were one.

But the incident with the ladybugs was one of the first times I realized my parents weren't the classic ""good parents"" and that my upbringing was not... Normal? Was not correct? I hesitate to say ""normal"" because I think in reality my upbringing was more normal than we like to think, but I think you know what I mean. Fuck those ladybugs. 

For those of you brought up in broken homes, or with addicts, or whatever tough crap you had to deal with, what was the first moment you realized that maybe things weren't ok in your home life? I mean, I obviously knew it wasn't right when my mom was at the bar every night or my dad was scream-fighting with his gf and calling her a crazy bitch and whatever other horrible things he would say, but it wasn't until I was able to compare my life to other kids around me that it really started to hit home. Before, I probably thought it was normal and this hard for everyone. I think realizing that other kids had loving, stable homes made it more real and a lot more difficult after that.

I think back in the day culture kind of naturally evolved ie would start on the coasts and make its way to the midwest and like a game of telephone it gets transformed as it moves through different areas and different cultures. Today because of the internet, social media, tiktok something that happens in California or New York is seen in real time by some kid in farmtown Indiana.

I would argue this has created a monoculture wher there's a single internet culture across the country instead of each area having its own character and culture kind of naturally forming and evolving as it moves across the country. 

I think some may conflate interests with culture ie there's a million plus subreddits for different interests but in terms of culture there's essentially one single culture.

If I'm in town, 70-80% of the time I'll have 1-2 social plans, almost always because I initiated it. If I don't initiate anything, I usually end up just doing things with my husband (being 20-30% of the time). 

I'm also very busy traveling and having family visit but I don't feel like I'm often declining invites because of my schedule.

I have 1 break during that time and I made social plans for then already but because I initiated it.

1) for other married people in their mid-30s, how often do you see friends/ have social plans? Do you consistently have social plans every weekend or is it normal to have a weekend with just your partner? 
2) do you have friends that you text with on a regular basis just to chat? I realize I don't... do I need to start developing a chatting relationship with to people to get closer to them?

Then he responded saying thay it was awesome and we had small talk about what we like about the church but then when i mentioned which service I go to on sundays the replying stopped and it just seemed like he went to sleep but when he saw my message in the morning he didn't reply.

1bzt2zr,2024-04-09 14:08:17,This emphasis on “learning a trade” isn’t as smart as everyone thinks it is when it comes to upcoming generations and employment,"Sure, society will always need electricians, plumbers, HVAC installers, pest control, etc etc. Some of those people make pretty solid money too (right now, relatively). But let’s examine some basic facts about why that is the case.


These fields are critically understaffed and have been for some time. This allows plumbers, electricians, mechanics, and what have you to charge pretty hefty premiums for their work. It is unequivocally skilled labor, and not abundantly available in the market if you’re looking to get it done.


There are also not that many derivatives of it. In most trade fields, you have a break down between residential and commercial services, with industrial sometimes being distinct from commercial (not always, depending on what specific trade it is). Being an electrician is basically being an electrician- there’s very little available in the way of specialization or differentiation from person to person. Trades are pretty much exact sciences.


So, let’s envision a society 20 or 30 years down the line where a substantial percentage of these outbound students pursued a trade. Basic economics, as you already know where I’m going with this, the market is saturated. The thing with trades, like plumbing, mechanics, electricians, etc is that while they will always be needed, they are not needed constantly. When there is a significant shortage of labor, it doesn’t matter too much because the existing professionals in the space get a ton of work. But in a saturated market, they don’t. They’ll be competing over smaller areas of service, and increased substitution options will force their prices lower. Lower price and reduced demand = bad for the laborer for any of the less economically inclined readers.


All of this is also ignoring the *major* industry consolidation happening in these trades right now. Private Equity funds are buying up these businesses at a rate you absolutely wouldn’t believe, and many of the trades are consolidating under a few big companies. Ultimately, it will be the same as being an accountant, but with a *much lower barrier to entry.* Skilled labor? Check. Consistent need? Check. Need for training and licensing? Check. Sure you could run your own little practice out of the strip mall (or your van, in the case of the trades) but the big industry players will dominate the market, doing exactly what corporations do to wages in a labor saturated market. 


I’ve just seen this “they need to get into the trades” idea floating around and wanted to say this. It is a great time to be in the trades currently. But if there is a mass generational push towards them, the competitive advantage of the people entering the field will be greatly diminished.",366,301,0.77,millenials,22,Tuesday,Afternoon

I'm struggling just to save enough to pay for their (very medically necessary) braces!

>If a Boomer (born 1945-1964) had kids when they were between the ages of 20-40, their kids were born between 1965-2004, making their children either Gen X, Millennial, or Gen Z.

>  
>In either case, you can expect that the Generation in the middle of the 3 possibilities will be the ""default"" and represent the largest number of cases, as the Generation to either side will tend to be outlier cases - the oldest members of the parent generation having kids early, or the youngest members of the parent generation having kids late.

Also, in case anyone was wondering this subreddit seems to use ""Boomer"" literally for Baby Boomer and they also apply it to a mindset. So, the usage depends on who you're talking to. But, I get it, the problem is all the same: out of touch old people.",207,0,0.36,millenials,13,Wednesday,Evening
1bzfie9,2024-04-09 01:19:07,Anyone else feel like they have to change their whole personality to fit in at work?,"I started a job a little over 7 months ago. The longer I’m there, the more I feel like I have to change my personality to fit what upper management/leadership wants. For reference, it’s a State government organization. Our groups is about 130 people. My job is mid-level. I have a PhD in my field and am about 3 years out of school. 

My team is great and I like my immediate supervisor. I’ve had no problems working with them, or feeling connected with them. Most of my team is early 30s-40s. 

Where I’m struggling a bit is conforming to the rigid hierarchical structure within the workplace that upper management enforces. Management is 50s-60s. You have to ask permission from higher up for every single thing. There is little room for pursuing professional development opportunities.  Additionally, they are so resistant to new ideas or any type of change. A lot of our procedures are archiac. If anyone proposes a new idea (via their supervisor because you can’t speak with management usually) there’s an excuse for why it can’t be considered. 

I am a fairly creative and curious person and also a fan of building community in everything I do. I feel like the culture of this workplace has taken that out of me. I no longer feel like proposing ideas for improving our work because they’ll just be shut down. The power dynamic is making it hard for me to feel like I’m part of a community.

 If I want to stop being disappointed, I’m going to have to adjust the way I approach work and view my position in the workplace. 

I’m realizing that this is  probably not the job for me, so I’m starting to look elsewhere. However, I’m wondering if I’m just being naive and idealistic about finding a good fit. Maybe it’s like his everywhere I have to learn to accept it.

Millennials outnumber Boomers and the difference increases every day. There is no doubt that prior policies have stacked things against the younger generations. More importantly those policies have consolidated wealth and power in a tiny fraction of the population and they use it to grab more every day. It’s time to stop blaming folks based on their age and start making the changes we need. It’s time to lead. It can be done but it takes numbers to beat the consolidated wealth at the top and the monopolies that plague every industry. 

We all need to vote. Support democracy and show its power. Voting rights, collective bargaining, antitrust legislation, campaign financing reform. These strengthen the power of democracy.

1bynek2,2024-04-08 03:06:29,Is it just me or is everything a scam now? ,"edit\* I've got a new one! So I paid \~$300 to ship a suitcase from France to the USA last month via Send My Bag. It arrived at its destination a full month late completely destroyed. Two of the four wheels were busted off, tape I used to secure it was ripped apart, zipper was wide open, my belongings were spilling out. Special stuffed animals, made for my son by my Grandma who is now departed were missing, probably fell out since the zipper was open. 

So I emailed the company. To my surprise, they sent me to some kind of complaints department, asked me to provide photos of the suitcase, details on each item missing plus the suitcase make, model, cost, and measurements. I spent a good hour researching the suitcase that I had bought at TJMaxx just six months before, went back and fourth with the customer complaint department about finding proof of purchasing it, finally a bank account statement showing the charge from six months ago sufficed. I spent another hour describing the stuffed animals in detail. They asked me for $ value for material cost for home-made items, so I priced it all out. 

Then, they concluded that they were not at fault because it says in fine print in their ""tips for shipping"" on their website that ""suitcases should not have wheels"". (Yea I know, what suitcases don't have wheels now a days?) The amount of rage I felt was so immense that I don't even remember the exact words I used to reply to them, but I imagine many explicits were used. 

So here is my gripe - not only did I over pay for this BS service, lose my suitcase, my son's momentos, but I also lost 2-3 hours of my life following up with these dick heads, plus 5 minutes writing this story out for your viewing pleasure! 

Again, the company is Send My Bag. Please help me drag them on the internet!



Can’t leave neglectful childcare because I signed some dumb contract a while back. Called social services, no one cares.

And this list is never ending. I have to stop myself from listing more.

1bzk6if,2024-04-09 05:16:29,I think the internet gave me the perspective to reject my own circumstances and myself,"I think this was only possible in a time when the internet was coming into existence.

I come from a very toxic kind of narcissistic MAGA kind of family, and I've always known since I was a pre-teen that it was fucked up and that I was kind of fucked because the abuse was too covert for me to ever really get outside help until I had to go get therapy for it way after the fact. There is a lot of shame involved in simply knowing that your family is kind of a stain on society and that you carry those psychological wounds on you that make you incompatible with regular children and their good enough family origins.

It's the access to the knowledge that prevents me from simply identifying counter-culturally from my origin because I know that regardless of whether I identify as left or right, liberal or conservative, good or bad, I will still ultimately be just like them wearing different colors unless I can change radically in a deep way that is impossible for a child to understand. In other words, It would have been easier if I could simply identify as the opposite, but the shame from the understanding ran so deep that I felt as though I could not, or did not have the right to, identify as anybody at all.

And it has been really hard. Because people in my life besides them have seemed to encouraged me being this kind of fawning support character for everyone but myself, and the people who reject me from their life seem to understand that I'm dealing with some issues but it seems like I'm never worth the effort of helping even when I'm forthcoming about all of it. In my personal experience (and a long period of intentionally testing the hypothesis with people), the only people who seem to be functioning well in life in their 20s have had their life pretty much set up for them by parents whose love for them was robust enough to extend into the future. Their privilege is an inner voice which is an echo of genuine, robust love that has carried through generations. I don't see many of these people, but they do exist. They have rose colored glasses, and some of them even understand their privilege, but have no way of helping the others.

But yeah, that's my experience.

My parents got a divorce when I was 10.

I have never had a father figure in my life.

I used to live with my mother who was dating few guys from time to time. They were always alcoholics. There were often some disgusting situations because of that (partying, screaming, etc.)

Then alcoholic grandma moved in with us.

Then, mother had a child with one guy. This guy left. We were all living together: me, my mother, sister and grandma. There's a 15 age gap between me and sister.

So there were 4 of us in a 2 room apartment. Me in 1 room and 3 of them in second room. This is a 35 square meter apartment (375 square feet).

Then mother met another alcoholic and he moved in with us. So 5 people in this small house. They were constantly drinking, screaming, etc.. They were inviting people over. It always used to end with some kind of catastrophe. My sister was with all of them in one room.

I couldn't take it anymore, couldn't live like this. I decided to move. My sister took over my old room. She is 15 now.

I've got a lot of physical and mental conditions thorough the years. Because of that, I'm not the same person that I used to be.

I'm sick and tired of playing this ""game"" where you are forced to put so much money into some stranger's pocket just to be able to live. Bills are one thing, but rent... Also I'm not able to constantly hold a job, so renting a studio flat is impossible for me in a long term. Renting only a room and living with strangers under one roof is also not possible. I've tried that a few times already and I had to run away after few days.

1byq276,2024-04-08 05:32:38,Younger generations don't care about community and relationships ,"I know this is obvious and widely known, but recently I have really been feeling the horrible repercussions of this cruel new reality, I feel a sense of loneliness so deep it feels like it runs through my bones, and I can't ignore or suppress it any longer, which I have only done because this particular societal issue often seems completely insurmountable, and it's easier to just not think about it.

I include myself in this of course, I don't pretend to be be the only millennial who hasn't fallen into this trap, of course I have, I am not accusing anyone, I am simply pointing out that if we don't do something about it, it will be detrimental to us.

People of millennial generation and younger don't seem to care about maintaining and nurturing relationships anymore. I am 29, when I talk about this with people around my age, they say ""yeah well that's just our generation isn't it?"" or ""well you know we're all quite busy, life is hard, things are expensive, we work a lot, we have things to do, we have other priorities, we have to focus on our future and personal health etc.""

That's all well and good... But at the same time there is currently a major epidemic of loneliness, isolation and depression. I'm sure there are many factors that contribute towards this, but surely people can put two and two together, don't people realise how important it is to prioritise social relationships just as much as work and health? Don't people realise how detrimental it can be to have very little, or no legitimate social connection? Humans are social creatures, we need other people. What good is working hard on physical health, opening a small business, buying a house, etc going to do if your mental health starts to decline due to the inevitable detrimental effects of social isolation? What's the point of anything if you're completely isolated from the world?

Recently there has been a major trend in caring for mental health, which is obviously great, people are no longer ashamed to admit they see a therapist, people rave about meditation and journaling and working on self-love, all very good things. But social connection is just as important for our mental health as all these other things. But people are ""too busy focusing on themselves to prioritise time with friends"".... Can they not see how much of a contradiction that is? 

Developing close relationships with others, being vulnerable with others, helping others, allowing others to help us, being an active part of our community, contributing to our community, these are all forms of self-love that people don't seem to be aware of, or just ignore. 

Psychologically, helping others and connecting with others greatly increases our self-confidence and our sense of purpose. From a neuroscience perspective, social interaction increases cognitive reserve and decreases physiological stress.. there are strong links between lack of social ties and mortality. 

It is a matter of utmost urgency that we all begin to prioritise our relationships and connection with our community as much as we prioritise work and physical/ mental health. 

We have become far too used to this as being the new norm, we use the excuse ""this is just the way things are now"", which is never a good enough excuse in my opinion. We should never accept something that is outright destroying our society by using the excuse ""this is just the way things are now""..... How many times have people tried to use that excuse in the past? To justify horrible circumstances? 

I shudder to think what the world would be like now if society had always, in history, succumbed to ""the way things are"" and never aimed for better.

1bxhmi0,2024-04-06 17:50:53,Anyone else know families where it's the kids who turned into MAGA cultists and no longer have a relationship with a liberal parent?,"I ask this because my older brother and his new wife are MAGA cultists, and my mom is a Democrat, and they recently had a falling out. My brothers new wife has had it out for my mom and my niece, just a beeatch to both of them and turning my brother against them. I'm pretty sure she dislikes my mom because she is a Democrat and dislikes my niece because she is half Mexican. My brother actually kicked my niece out of his house (she is over 18), and my mom went off on him and told my niece she can live with her and my stepdad, and then told my brother to get his mobile home the hell off her land. He told her he would never speak to her again as long as he lives. It's been weeks, he still hasn't apologized to his daughter or my mom. He is seriously looking for his own land to move his trailer to. I guess he's just not gonna have a relationship with my mom or his daughter anymore and go through all that trouble and expense. 

My brother was born in '77. Guy was brought up in a diehard Democrat house, but was always completely apolitical himself. But he also wasn't always the brightest person, and he was always more of a macho meathead type than me, and he always showed signs of really strong homophobia. I guess I shouldn't be so shocked. MAGA preyed on undereducated apolitical people who had underlying reactionary tendencies.

She’s the most caring person I know. We only get to talk a few times a month because we both work a lot, but when we do it’s always a great conversation. 

I’m pretty introverted by nature. I don’t like to open up and share when I’m struggling because I don’t want to bother other people with my problems. I have a lot of pride and independence and don’t like to rely on other people. This has actually caused some strain in my marriage, but I’m going to counseling to help deal with some of that. About a month ago I was put on a performance improvement plan at work. Basically if I don’t show improvement I’m going to be fired. I was already severely depressed and this sent me into a spiral. Everyday I felt like I was walking under water and could barely speak. I have a family that depends on me and the pressure to better myself is overwhelming. 

My wife told my mom that I was struggling because she couldn’t get through to me. Mom called me and just let me talk. She encouraged me and told me that everything would work out. And, if things got too hard to call her regardless of what time it was because she is always there for me. 

Today I got a card in the mail (she’s old school like that). Here’s what it said:

“My sweet boy,

Words can never express how very proud of you I feel. You have always been a hard worker, and a great husband and daddy. 
No matter what happens with this job, you will be just fine. A job does not define the person you are, it’s just a job. Everything will work out the way it’s supposed to (those are your grandmothers words). Whatever you need, we will always be here for our boy. I’ll continue prayers. 

All my love,

Mom”

Guys, I’m a 35 year old man with a wife and kids. They think I’m strong like a rock. And I sobbed like a little boy when I read that. She’s truly the best. 

Edit: I guess from the replies I should say that I’m 35. My mom is 65. So yes, being born in 1959, she’s a boomer ",459,1469,0.9,millenials,26,Saturday,Night

I've been very open about my own experiences in therapy including a long-term stay for an eating disorder in my early 20's. They were supportive even though they didn't quite understand, but my mom is still very opposed to therapy and believes she doesn't need it. Whenever I gently suggest she may benefit from speaking to a third-party, she acts as if I slapped her in the face.

My parents are tail-end Boomers, and my mom is a first-generation immigrant (moved here as a young child) so that may have an extra impact on her views of therapy. But mostly, I want her to be able to enjoy her retirement years and not be dealing with emotional stress and the physical symptoms of anxiety.

If we want to change it, we have to do it.

if we start a movement now, a foundation, even with three people that are enthousiastic. then start lobbying. start attracting members, more members, and more members, and start marketing, marketing, marketing. I am very, very, very sure that in 40 years, 45 max, we CAN make a difference. we can in fact change the tides and work towards a more equal and just democratic system in the USA. we can work towards a system that is there for everyone, free from gerrymandering, making polarization redundant because there are way more than 2 parties.

Guess what, we were. Gen X started the ""let your freak flag fly"" culture and we expanded on that. Do you all not remember Hipster culture? Anything and everything could have been cool and trying something weird was not only encouraged but applauded. Remember how Austin and Portland were our Meccas? These weird cities that were proud to be different. We pushed for LGBTQ+ to become mainstream, we pushed for more women in power, we pushed for more diversity in media and power. That was us. 

Bernie was our guy. We said ""fuck this job."" We fought against capitalism by pushing boutique businesses, small craft shops (beer especially), we pushed for self-care over job loyalty. We set the stage for a push to leftism over liberalism. That was us. 

I think Gen Z is mostly doing a great job carrying that torch forward, and this isn't meant to put us over them but I think a lot of us are looking at them with rose-colored glasses. Social media pressure has pushed them into a culture of sameness, of rage bait, and of monetization. Do you think Andrew Tate would have had a platform in millennial culture? Do you think millennials would pay thousands of dollars to attend Alpha Male day camp? Do you think we would stand for the way online dating culture treats women AND men for that matter now? The fact is we have lost a lot of ground in the last 8 years and it isn't only the boomers, there are a scary amount of young people (young men primarily) pushing this trad/breeder stuff and that simply would not have flown with the mustachioed millennials. 

So let's grow out of our self-effacing stage and be proud of how much we moved the culture forward. We had legitimate reason to believe that we had won the culture war before the shock of 2016, and we can and will regain that ground soon. Be proud of what we've done, don't get stuck on how immature we were in highschool because every generation is immature as teenagers. Most importantly, we're not done changing the world. We're just getting started.",251,419,0.85,millenials,13,Wednesday,Afternoon

1bu05bz,2024-04-02 14:29:05,Anyone else's liberal parents addicted to Trump?,"Something that's been driving me up the wall lately. My parents are as democrat and liberal as they come, as am I, and they seem to have an unhealthy obsession with Trump. Almost a full mirror of a conservative who's an overzealous fan. It's something several of my friends have noticed with their parents as well. Whether their parents love or hate him, none of my millenial friends have had a conversation with their parents in years in which he wasn't brought up in some way. It's like an addiction. He's truly the boomer ego in human form. An amalgamation of an entire generation's hubris and narcissism taking its swan song.

We could be talking about something completely irrelevant, and it's almost become a game to me, waiting for the inevitable, ""Did you hear what Trump said yesterday???"". The family group chat has at least one Trump joke every day. For years.

Personally, I keep very up to date on any important updates and am involved in politics, but I determined the man's character for myself 6 years ago. I don't need to know the 50th deranged thing he's said this week.

I don't know how to get them to stop thinking about him all day every day. I agree with their sentiments on him but it's honestly unhealthy for them and for our relationship if they have nothing else current to talk about. I've joked to them about it before and they laugh and go ""I know, I know"". Then 10 minutes later there's a new hot take from facebook they need to share.

&#x200B;

Edit: WOW I did not expect this to blow up like it did. I can't escape the irony now of an errant thought/rant I had about avoiding overindulging in Trump-related news blew up into a 3,000 comment thread about that very subject in the matter of hours.

To respond to a few common/recurring themes here:

* For liberal-minded posters: Just because I have had some feelings of burnout related to the subject when it involves my family doesn't mean I am downplaying the gravity of the situation. The potential re-election of Trump into office is a very real threat with very real and severe consequences.
* For conservative-minded posters: ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" is a useless and dismissive phrase being used to downplay the very real threat and very real consequences of a Trump re-election, and wave off any criticism of a person who is objectively dangerous to this country, and objectively a poor representative of who we should strive to be as Americans and as human beings. Our children deserve better role models.
* I have not mentioned anything in this post about any other politicians or political policies. You are entitled to whatever opinion you want about those. This post is about Trump, a very unique individual in regards to how he acted in and out of the office of President, how the media acts with him, and how he has affected people in our parent's generation.",11628,13220,0.7,millenials,7,Tuesday,Afternoon

1bulviu,2024-04-03 06:41:37,I want a second kid but I just found out my employer will be letting me go.,"I’m 34 and married.  My husband works and has a good job, but I made about $10k more than he did.  His health insurance is really good, too, so as long as he stays employed with the railroad, I’m not worried specifically about insurance.  I am a little about bills and getting a job.

But I’m frustrated that things I want keep getting pushed back because of others.  We already have an 8 month old.  And if I wasn’t 34, I wouldn’t be overly concerned about waiting a year or so.

But my employer basically hired me to make sure another person had a job (hired me to train someone else) and never had any intention of giving me a job for next year.  I’m a teacher FYI.  Ironically, pay is not my issue because I’m paid well comparatively, but the disrespect I personally have faced is mind blowing.  And…I’ve been dicked around in this profession for years.  11 to be exact.  This happened at another district, too, where I was hired and the district had no intention of keeping me beyond my contract probation period.  Both times, they just gave my position to a man.  The people who took my job both times didn’t even interview.  They literally just asked for it. 

So…I’m done with teaching.  I have advanced education.  If you want to know what it is, I have an MBA and a masters in Curriculum and Instruction.  The MBA is new and I haven’t even had it a year and have never worked in business.

I’m fighting an internal battle about having a second kid.  I know job loss is temporary.  It might be for a long time or a short time.  And my parents are pretty well off.  They’d never allow us to lose our house or my car or anything.  I’m very fortunate to have the support I do.  And, if my husband and I have a second kid, we’ll be okay in the long run.

My life imploded May 18th, 2021 when my brother shot himself.  I was the last to see him and I walked away for a brief second.  Heard the gunshot, but didn’t even know that’s what it was.  I walked back in a minute later with the help and there he was.  Just sitting there.  Dead.  32 years old.  And I walked away.  And I shouldn’t have.  But I did,  and since then, I’ve done nothing but make one dumb decision after another, starting with my decision to leave a stable employer because I was having PTSD hallucinations of him in school that I was teaching at and the one we both went to as kids.

I’m just so sad and depressed.  I feel used.  I feel unappreciated.  I feel like I don’t matter.  I feel like I’m letting my child down.  I feel like I’m letting my husband down.  I feel like I’m not doing life right and I’m stupid for even wanting a second kid.  I feel a disappointment. I panic about my kid deciding to do what my brother did.  I haven’t been able to sit in total silence since May 2021.  I can’t sleep without the TV on.  I think he’s here in my house even though he never knew I was buying one because he died only 6 days after we were told our offer was accepted.  My baby’s nursery is the room I planned to give him.  I bought this specific house so he could come here when he was feeling sad and depressed and he never even knew about it.

I don’t even know why I wrote this.  Probably because it’s 2:40am and it makes me feel a little less alone.

My parents prioritized school work and I let them down by being terrible in school. I understand completely the value of playing sports and that's why I am pushing my kids to do sports. You learn team work, get fit, you deal with challenges better, and the overall benefits of exercise on mental health and wellness. You also develop friendships and better memories than I had watching Futurama in my parent's basement.

The issue is that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. My kids are not athletic. They are just below average in terms of performance. That doesn't dissuade me and as long as they enjoy the sport, I'm happy to keep paying for it. I just can't coach them very well and I'm disappointed that I can't do more to keep them engaged in the sport. The better they are, the more likely they are to stick with it.

Just a rant, thanks for listening.

Edit: Some really good feedback which I appreciate but also some people missing the point. We're a VERY active family. We bike together almost daily, we hike on almost any given weekend, we ice skate and ski TOGETHER.

I don’t live in a particularly expensive part of the US.  Bought a house at 22 in 2006 I think.  No down payment.  All those shenanigans at the time.  Atrocious interest rate.  Bank gave me the loan even though I didn’t have solid employment or whatever.  Was just getting started.  But apartment complex lease was coming up and they had bumped the the rent up to like 800 bucks.  Figured fuck it, at that price might as well be paying towards something.

So I bought at the peak of the bubble.  House value got cut in half after it all went wrong (just now finally recovering value)… I just continued to pay down principal.  Triple payments etc when work was going well.  Minimum payments when work was going shitty.  Took about 16 years.  6 years longer than I had hoped.

I think that there is no wrong time to buy.  From my experience.  I have no bills anymore (except utilities, taxes, insurance, etc).  Everything is paid for.  Feel completely free. And I bought at arguably the worst time possible.  What am I missing from this conversation?  Is it not being able to secure a loan that is the problem?

Because of this, there will be a few things that are going to hurt the economy and everyone else as well.

1. They are unable to buy property = property prices are going to fall when there isn't enough demand for it. Remember that Gen Z and Alpha have fewer people than millennials and going forward most countries will have fewer and fewer people unless they get a ton of immigrants from 3rd countries. And yeah I know this is a good thing to a certain point, but it will also effect negatively a large portion of normal people whos money is in the property.
   * Investment companies though will have a field day...
2. Millenials spend less and less money on ""non-essentials"" which means eating out, movies, hobbies, etc. which means less customers for these businesses and will lead to higher prices to keep the businesses at float probably. Again this is purely because they can't afford these extra niceties, so no blame from here.
3. Prices are only going to go up since boomers are getting older and are ready to spend their life savings to have ""fun"" while it lasts. This means millennials will not get much money from their parents once they die or non at all, in most cases. Also, elderly care is very expensive so boomers might even be forced to use the rest of their money just to get by once they get older.
4. Millenials are struggling financially meaning most of them will pass on making children completely or leave it too late meaning they simply can't even have children anymore, thus leading to even larger shortage of future generations.

Combining all of this with the fact that millennials were handed the short stick of the draw financially. Millennials have lived through 3x economic crashes 1990s, 2008, and 2020. Meaning they were most likely born in poverty or their families struggled financially in some form and every time they were supposed to get into the workforce there has been some form of economic crisis pushing them back.

So combining all of this I feel like there will be some consequences for everyone unless millennials are given a break at some point since it's such a huge amount of people who must feel like they have been left behind in everything.

Now, we are leaving dead wasteland of the Internet behind us for Gen-z and Gen-x to cry in. As our gen is entering professional life, it's time for us to devour the world again, with AI","If boomers screwed economy, wy screwed everything else.

We were the generation to experience the Internet in the best possible way and time. We had our cake and ate it to too; we had our early childhood without addictions, without culture wars and outrage content manafactured to click.

We had time to be curious explorers outside, we ran with sticks, imagining we are wizards and heroes, we played and had fun with friends. Our brains developed more or less healthily just in time to eat the cake as it was still fresh - the Internet - after it was already fit for personal use, but before it commercialized and died.

It was literally at the best time possible. Besides the obvious: easy access to infinite knowledge, memes, games, porn, sense of belonging to ***genuine*** niche communities and movements, we were riding the greatest change human civilization experienced, ever. And for a kid, fast disruptive change is a jackpot better than porn.

The sad ruins of the dead Internet we left behind for gen-z and gen-alpha is a terrible dopamine prison overloaded with identity politics. Manafactured outrage powered by all-consuming human loneliness and foreign interests. There is no content, no culture, no novelty, no creativity. It's only dying wasteland. 🎶 There are thousands of the best experts tirelessly working overtime in tall glass buildings, to manafacture content and systems that exploit teens' dopamine systems in the most efficient way. The name of the current competition is: how can we dysregulate gen-z and gen-x's dopamine systems the best?

How cruel must be gods to give us another cake now AI. As we enter our professional life, and have less time for the dead Internet, but we are starting to use AI in its infancy for productivity. Generating images and solving tasks with AI feels a bit like frontier spirit of the Early Internet. Other generations are brainrot from the Internet that gave them no chance to learn, but we are well-equipped to devour remnants of culture using AI tools, and shit out sludge that will cover the world for our children to die in.

I feel it’s imperative for people to gain perspective and actively seek a more well-rounded view of the world. The younger generation, it seems, has become very dogmatic with certain issues and I’m wondering if I’m just seeing glimpses of my former selves in them, should give them grace and room to grow, or if I’m right in not having much faith in their ability to adapt.

I guess a few examples of me changing my mind should be given
- I used to be very anti-law enforcement. Acab, fuck the police, all that. I’d had very awful encounters with police at a young age (arrested for marijuana at 18, was mocked by police, ultimately led to me being kicked out of TAMU). Having had quite a few more interactions with different police officers in my 20’s, even knowing a few personally, I have a completely different view of law enforcement. I know now that they have an incredibly difficult job, can’t be generalized and condemned because of poor representation, and are absolutely necessary for maintaining a healthy society

- I used to be very anti-gun and against the second amendment. I damned firearms as death dealers with only one purpose which was inherently evil. As I’ve gotten older I now have a few and feel much differently. I respect the history of firearms. I’m appreciative of all the food produced with the use of guns and all the protection provided by those who needed them. They’re also super fun and require a great amount of skill and maintenance. That being said, safety and proper knowledge of firearms are imperative when it comes to ownership or use.

- ubi. I used to be **very** supportive of universal basic income. With so much automation and the ever-looming development of ai, I felt it was important that people reap the benefits of such advancements. I felt we should all be cut a check. Then covid happened lol I was laid off because my company sold the property I worked for and received unemployment. For 2 years I was the least motivated to work while getting those checks. Ultimately I became much lazier and absolutely unproductive. Since I started working again, and getting promotions and better job offers that I’ve taken, I feel much more validated and happy going to work doing something I love. I realize that seems anecdotal, but I also work directly with people on welfare. Many are kind, compassionate, and require it, but just as many don’t, and are milking the system without repercussion, and are honestly blights on society.

There’s so much more but I think I’ve spent a little too long on the shitter making this post lol

What are some things y’all have changed your minds on that you thought you never would?

*Ninja edit/update: I wanna make it clear before people take it the wrong way, I am not criticizing Gen Z or the kids I saw. It's cool, and honestly my cohorts were all probably a bunch of douchebags in 2001. Being a douchebag was kinda cool then for some reason. I'm not really making any point with my post, just being an old man yelling at cloud amazed at how different teens are now from when I was one.*  
  
*Another addition: this post probably ~~begs~~ raises the question of what we would have been talking about. (u/sorosmademesaythis pointed out this is an incorrect use of the term begs the question) A little younger it would have been pokemon, hands down. Then N64 games, girls, whatever CD we just bought, football, WWF NWO wrestling, sex (we'd never had it but wished we had), eventually how cool GTA 3 was. Probably always one of those topics.*
  
I'm resting on a couch at the gym after working out. Baylor vs USC women's basketball is on a TV.   
Five teenaged boys, three with the broccoli cut, were watching the game *intensely* and talking about their brackets. I gathered from their talk that they mean women's NCAA brackets. After a while the conversation switched to Chess. The board game.   
  
I am 35 and I forget that I'm not a teenager some times. Like, I know I'm past it, but I feel like I'm adjacent. But only until I am actually around them.

I worry because my brother was completely obsessed with video games growing up and was hardly regulated.  He spent most of his childhood playing and, I believe, it had a lot of negative consequences.

Recently, my son's close friend has gotten in to Minecraft and reportedly now stays home just playing for hours on end.  We no longer meet them at the playground nor do they play sports together.  

I get that interests change but this seems like a downgrade to me.

Do you have rules around video games with your kids?  Is the situation overall not as bad as I perceive it to be?  I'm under the impression that a large percentage of kids are missing from the playground because they are at home on screens instead.

Curious to hear your impressions and if you have set rules around this for your own kids to hear how it's going for you & your family.

1bqwyk7,2024-03-29 18:54:10,"Do you guys think we really have inflation, or do you think it’s Collective Overvaluation that’s creating a Price Fixed Market?","I personally think we may have a little bit of inflation, but what we’ve been seeing since the start of the pandemic is everyone from McDonald’s and Wendy’s to Home Sellers, Landlords with Rentals, and Car Dealerships collectively overvaluing their products, goods, services, Real Estate, and Rentals, and created a price fixed market to wallet drain all their customers.

I think Letetia James uncovered this with the Donald Trump stuff, which he DID really commit a real crime. It’s not victimless, because when you overvalue stuff, you end up creating an inflated market, and there’s a lot of victims, because it’s like a Ponzi Scheme where eventually someone will be left screwed and holding the buck, all the while everyone else made off like Bernie Madeoff, with everyone’s money. 

The issue I personally think is every State Attorney General has been really lazy, and their office staff have not been properly investigating the local markets to see Gas Stations and Grocery Stores screwing everyone by jacking up prices all the time. Believe it or not, they do have laws in place that don’t allow them to just jack their prices up and price gouge everyone. 

And the grossest example of this is Landlords and Homesellers, as well as Used Car Sales. They all collectively colluded to create an overvalued inflated price fixed market, and what they’re all doing is highly illegal, but hasn’t yet seemed to be investigated by local State Attorney Generals, with the exception of Letitia James.

Hopefully it’s a trend that influences other State Attorney Generals and Senators to get off their asses and do their jobs, to bust up Price Fixing, and prosecute Landlords, and Home Sellers who dupe people into overpaying for their lower valued Real Estate.

1bq584i,2024-03-28 20:06:34,'Willful Ignorance' is a 100% valid and morally defensible mental health strategy.,"I've tried all my life to stay ""plugged in"" and support positive change in the world. But a consistent through-line, between 2000 and 2022, was that I slid consistently down into the depths of brutal indifference, depression, even nihilism. There was a clear connect to how ""informed"" I was.

Then, in 2022, I blue-screened and shut it all off - all the news, all the comms apps, and most social media. A remarkable thing happened; my 'world' shrunk to the 4 walls of my house and neighborhood and I found that that world... was *awesome*. Not perfect. But awesome, in its own small way. I've spent the last two years rediscovering gratitude, people I love, and the value of 'small things.'

Bottom line, **do what you can do to effect positive change and then** ***sever the rest***, physically, mentally, emotionally. Yes, it's important to be informed and to push for progress. But the onslaught of this world's constant horrors, through the window of your phone, is not only counterproductive. It'll destroy you.

1bq7d3f,2024-03-28 21:32:18,How old were you when you heard the term millennial?,"I was born in '87, and my entire childhood everybody lumped us in with gen x. Basically if you were an older kid in the 1990s, adults considered you to be a genexer. Gen x didn't have good connotations back then either. The stereotype for a typical genexer was someone who was kind of borderline criminal almost. Rude and disrespectful at best.

I remember there were these PSAs on TV in the mid 90s trying to rebrand generation x, and it featured teenagers dressed in gen x fashion doing gen x things like skateboarding, but without the negative stereotypes of being rude and disrespectful. And they referred to gen x and ""generation excellent.""

I didn't hear the word millennial until I was an adult, and everyone's perception at the time was that it applied to kids in the noughties (2000s or whatever you want to call them lol). I feel like people assumed it applied to the children of genexers. Like if your parents were boomers you were a genexer, and your kids were millennials. Like I realize not everyone has kids at the same age, so like that wouldn't apply to a late boomer who had kids in their 40s, but my parents were mid boomers born in the mid 50s, making them the average age for boomers, and they had me in their late 20s (I'm wanting to say my mom was like 27 and my dad was like 29 at the time).

It feels like the gap between generations is getting compressed by five years with each subsequent generation. Like the boomer period was '45-'65, and gen x was '65-'81; but millennials were '81-'96, gen z was '96-2010, and alpha starts in 2010 and nobody knows when the cutoff date will be.

Could  you please help me with some ideas? I wonder what you guys would enjoy as Millenials? 

As we only have one day, they should be short and cheap, and can definitely be silly.   

Things I thought about already:   

\- Go to our favourite brunch place and order sth he never ordered before  
\- Go to a fortune teller (= I do some silly fortune telling for him)  
\- Change baby diapers (on a doll, as we are expecting our first child at the moment)  
\- Try a milkshake  
\- Play a boardgame in a weird location  
\- Get a tattoo (= washable sticker)  
\- Paint your hair (washable paint)  
\- Try a new form of exercise (karate or similar video from youtube)  
\- Gambling (at home only, we bet against each other)  
\- Visit a park we never went to

1br119s,2024-03-29 22:13:10,"Millennials, I have read some of you lament your own lack of social skills, and blame your parents. At first I rejected this notion, and blamed the individual, but I have experimented with my own baby, and believe I have “tricked him” to be social and bilingual, by making him believe it’s normal.","TL;DR: I understand many millennials will not want to read my long post, and you do not need to read it; I conditioned my baby son to be very social with slow, steady practice.


My son is 3, and my wife and I have “tricked” him into being bilingual already (English and Japanese) and being abnormally social.

At 15 months I started having him say hello to a child’s parent whenever he would play with another child. Later that month I stepped it up to having him say hello to the doorman and employees in stores. By 2 years old I was playing games where he would say hello to 5 strangers on the street each day in NYC.

By now at age 3 I have created a “social monster” who is confident to befriend anyone he sees. We are on vacation, he ran up to these teenagers and is all like “Oi! Oi! Oi! Will you play with me?” After three hours of free babysitting from these kids, I snapped this pic.

YES, maybe those who complain about a lack of social abilities are right; our parents do/should have an obligation to teach us to be social, the same way you teach a child to talk and walk.

What I taught the child about being social:

1. Choose a target and get close; say hello
2. Share something with them; a toy, candy, high five
3. If you’re not friends yet, move onto another child

Other than those basic steps, I let him find his own answers.

** Use caution parents, I’m not sure I recommend this at such a young age. Yes my son has a powerful skill at a young age, but he also gets super lonely staying at home now, so you constantly have to feed his need to make more new friends, and it is not ever enough. He also puts a low value on a single friend, thinking more are easy to get. When a young child is able to “get what he wants from people” socially, it’s hard to stick and iPad in front of him all afternoon.

This matters because a child with no fear of strangers is in danger, and obviously requires constant supervision. My son wants to meet everyone he can, child or adult. Not everyone likes being approached by a random child, but most people do. If you think about it negatively, I am allowing my son to be rude and intrusive, but he has learned to make the experience positive with those he tried to befriend.

 If I could do this experiment again, I would start at an older age, maybe 5 years old. I love that he is social and makes friends easily. On the flip side he is already starting to see friendships as disposable, so there is a “double edged sword” to this phenomenon.

Rant/Nostalgia/looking for advice from others with relatable experiences.","Hey all. A lot of us probably wondered why our parent/s seemingly didn't have friends while they were raising us. Some of us had parents involved in church and would see the same people every week, but we could see even as kids that those weren't the same kinds of friends that we had as kids. We'd never end up like them - we knew how to keep friendships going better than they did of course.

Elementary school, we would get home from school, get on a bike or skateboard, and ride around the neighborhood until we saw another friend or just knock on doors asking if Jimmy could play. These friendships grew, and our friend groups grew, until we were teenagers and getting into shenanigans. Sneaking out to climb on buildings and walk on railroad tracks in the middle of the night, all of us having a crush on the same girl and learning how to deal with that through praise and heartbreak, having inside jokes formed through experiences you had in the same place at the same time, laughing way too hard at Superbad.

And then everyone graduates or drops out. The adult tiers are formed. Everyone moves away from eachother. 

You see who isn't going to make it; friends who can hopefully keep a steady job at walmart and can retire for a bit before they die. Being the weed or booze guy in high school kept them socially afloat.

You see who absolutely made it; friends who got their degree and you know will have a positive impact on the world. Had their weddings at a venue, guest lists exceeding 50 people. You're invited, but don't know anyone, ans you're actually surprised you're not in the wedding. Surprised because it took you too long to get it.

Everyone moves on. This great tree of relationships that you spent years cultivating to be a tightly-knit group, thinking it would last forever,  has its branches growing in every different direction.  Some falling off the tree, and some branches blossoming and growing higher than you can reach.

You may have work colleagues, a PTA meeting, an HOA, a professional relationship with your community, but you'll never have that tree again. No one you ever talk to will ever know the context of your childhood and young adulthood, nor do they need to.

 The tree is still there, but the trunk is hollow, and you can't reach the branches.",14,27,0.86,millenials,28,Thursday,Night

Edit: Notice none of the comments disputed what I posted. The comments responding to my post contact no verifiable facts, no empirical data points, no substantiative counter arguments. Just mindless echo chamber comments.

The point differential boomers voted for was four points for Trump. For the previous generation (Silent Generation) it was a differential of 19 points for Trump. You millennials and Gen Z can't even get your generations straight.

Again, the whining generation that has contributed very little for the betterment of humankind. Only benefiting from what past generations brought forth. Your generation is one that can't accept the fact that older generations are in a better place because it took thirty years of struggling. While you expect to be given things right out the womb.

You are SUPPPOSED to struggle while you are young. On the upside you have something you really don't value right now- youth. It's an amicable tradeoff.

1bp2ylv,2024-03-27 14:16:34,Boomerang Boomers,"There is a now a phenomenon where millennial's parents are moving in with their children's home. Which is surprising that the best off generation is moving with the worst off generation for support.

I bring this up because I am in that boat. My wife and I are homeowners who were lucky enough to buy a house at a reasonable price in 2015. At the time we had a toddler and a newborn. I was, am still working a part time job on top of my full time job to cover daycare cost. My wife works full time as well. Overall we had our hands full. 


My father-in-law had just spent a period of his life unemployed. When his parents died, he inherited a large sum of money and had lived off that money while not working until that money dried up. With that money gone,  at age 65, he decided he needed to rebuild.

 My wife offered our home for him to recover for a year.  It seemed like a sweet deal for both of us. He would recover financially while helping us out. He got a part time job to make money to save money. And would help with 1-2 days a week babysitting. For a while that worked great.

But that one year turned to 5 years. He seems to have no plan to leave. He no longer helps with babysitting. He complains when we make too much noise in our house. And will frequently go on far-right political rants. While my wife and I cannot bring up anything political because it might offend him. 

He has also been known to have a tantrum when I don't offer him food I made for my kids or wife. Or not bring home takeout when I take my kids to a restaurant.

I also feel he is a determent to my childrens up bringing. When I tell my kids, no more screen time, they will just go downstairs where my father in law is and watch cartoons. I ask that they don't. But my father in law ignores my parenting and does what he wants. He also provides them so much candy and sweets that my daughter is getting overweight. 

Anytime we have brought up a plan for him to move out, he changes the subject. Or says he wants to buy a house, which at age 70 with little money saved, seems a little ridiculous. We as a couple feel stuck with him in the house. But we aren't ready to legally evict him. 

Just curious, does anyone else have boomerang parents? Or am I alone in this struggle. ",458,440,0.86,millenials,2,Wednesday,Afternoon

1bqevi6,2024-03-29 03:07:41,Racism in the Small Business Arena,"Today I arrived at my privately leased office and there was a door tag 🏷️ on it preventing me from entering my unit due to late payment. I immediately connected to the WiFi and made the payment, spoke to the receptionist and waited on a resolution. After about five minutes, I asked about the unit. When would I be let back in? I was told to send an email to the community manager. Okay. We had a brief discussion about it, and I sent the email. No profanity. Just a normal conversation. I am a black woman and both of the receptionists present are white women. We are in the southwest US. 

After the email was sent, I went to the receptionist’s office. No one was there, so I looked at her laptop. She sent a teams message to her manager (the person I emailed) and said that I cussed her out. The screen was live, so I typed in “I’m lying. She didn’t cuss at me. I’m just being a cunt and not doing my job.” Into the teams message. Inappropriate? Sure but I thought it was funny. I also took a bag of wristbands from the receptionist’s office to make a petty point. Hold my office hostage, I take something of yours in return. 

I emailed the manager who responded with a wild response about my behavior being unacceptable blah blah blah. At this point, forty minutes have elapsed. No one has come to unlock the door and the manager says she has to wait on the finance department. This is clearly a lie, so I pressed her and told her that she is constructively evicting me by not immediately allowing me back into the unit. She ignored my emails thereafter and…get this…told the receptionist to call the sheriff. Two deputies walked me out of my own job today and I am certain it is race-related. The reason I said this is because two other business owners (also female and black) asked for assistance with her rental agreement during her renewal period to downgrade to a virtual office. They ignored these requests. 

People are often oblivious to the insidious way that race relations don’t just impact individuals and bash black people in the US for not making progress. I come from a fairly well off family and we still have to deal with this nonsense from jealous people in the dwindling white majority. This is why DT is so popular. They know their time is ending if not over, so they are holding on by their fingernails to last vestiges of power they have.

One of my friends was raised by their grandparents since he was 2, birth mom died and father is non-existent, and both grandparents were born in 1942. Unfortunately, one of them passed away a few years ago. My friend is 32.

The other friend was born to a dad who is from 1944 and her mom from 1957. So two different generations. My friend is 28. I will not forget when I called her Dad grandpa when we were in elementary school, I still feel embarrassed.

I only know that my my father was born 1961 (he is the typical boomer cliche) and my mother 1968 (but my mother was not raised in America so I am not sure if she counts). I'll be turning 29 soon.

Looking back on my life, it feels like my life progressed normally up until 2020 when the pandemic hit. That’s when reality seemed to completely unravel, although perhaps 2016 is when things started to become “hyperreal” with the election of Trump and the ensuing news cycle.

I was 32 years old when the pandemic started. I was in a place where I felt like I was about to transition to a new phase of life. My career just started and I was enjoying the night life and social scene of the city I was living, hoping to find someone to settle down with soon.

Then I woke up today. I’m 36 years old now, still luckily in my established and well paid career. But now I’m back home working remotely from my dad’s house, as he lost his job during the pandemic and needed help to keep the house. I remember very little of 2020, and most of 2021. I spent 2022 and 2023 back in the city I grew up in but have been away from for so long that I no longer kept contact which childhood friends. I’ve spent this time doing little outside of being hyper focused on my hobbies and being chronically online.

I get complimented a lot on how young I look for my age. When I talk to someone from Gen Z, I perceive them as being the same age as me but I get taken aback frequently at how vast the age gap between them and myself actually is. I literally feel like a man that has been cryogenically asleep for 5 years. 

Anyone else notice how sudden it seems like us millennials became irrelevant in the wider culture. It seems like yesterday we were the young up and coming generation….but today we are middle aged?

I look in the mirror and see a 28 year old bachelor, but inside I know that I’m 36 and most men my age have kids that are old enough to at least be in kindergarten.

I’m not depressed about it, because I don’t see it as I got left behind or something, but I do find it disorienting. I want to start dating again but I don’t know how I fit in. I went out with a girl a few months ago, 31 single mother of 3, who was shocked and called me an old man when she found out my age. I met another girl recently who I also thought was young, but when we were talking she mentioned she was 35 and has a 15 year old.

Using 1990 as a benchmark, globally:
* Malnourishment dropped from 18.3% to 8.9%.
* General tech advancements. We all talk shit about bad habits caused by the internet and smartphones, but having the world's knowledge at our fingertips is beyond incredible.
* Literacy has increased from 86% to 92%.
* Child mortality has dropped 60%.
* Life expectancy has increased from 64.2 years to 72.8 years.
* Extreme poverty has dropped from 36% to 9% (!!!).

In the US, using 1990 as a benchmark unless otherwise specified:
* The poverty rate has decreased from 15.9% to 10.5%.
* Violent crime has dropped from 758 incidents per 100k to 388. This is even crazier in major cities like NYC, where in raw numbers homicides dropped from ~2500 to ~380.
* Infant mortality has dropped from 10.8 deaths per 1000 to 5.6 deaths per 1000.
* Life expectancy has increased from 74 to 79 years.
* The Soviet Union and the ever-present threat of nuclear war ended.
* Access to clean water increased from 88% to 99.4%.
* Median household income (inflation-adjusted) has increased from $52k in 1980 to $86k in 2019. Caveat that this doesn’t necessarily mean millennial income has also increased the same.
* Median net worth has increased from $94k to $186k (inflation-adjusted).
* A massive increase in diversity.

This isn’t to ignore student loan debt and some of the comparisons between millennials and baby boomers in terms of wealth, but some of that is anomalous (boomers and the US economy benefited from Europe being annihilated in WW2).

1bn62r9,2024-03-25 05:30:04,Getting duped by Boomers when buying Homes,"From my personal experience, I think it’s a really bad idea to buy a home until you’re well past the age of 42, just because the older people involved are predatory, and trying to dupe you, and rip you off every step of the way. Home Sellers, especially Boomer, and Older Gen X Sellers are looking to dupe Millennial buyers and the houses are in most cases misrepresented by the Realtors, Brokers, and Sellers, and they prey on 1st time buyers, and know they’re naive and gullible, because it’s their 1st house, and it takes years to uncover and piece together all the crimes that are committed by these people. 

If you do intend to buy a home, make sure you sue the Seller for any form of duping and misleading they do, such as if they list the house as a 3 bedroom, and the septic is only rated for a 2 bedroom, and the house is listed with the Town as being a 2 Bedroom, sue everyone involved for misrepresentation. When you go to sell, if you sell it as a 3 Bedroom, you’ll end up getting sued yourself. 

It’s a really dirty business. Also Home Inspectors are most of the time crooked and just pass everything, and most of the time, the Realtor knows them, and they work together to sell the house. The Inspector passes everything, and the Realtor recommends him to new clients. That’s how that works. 

I advocate if you’re gonna buy, don’t be afraid to make a relationship with a Real Estate Attorney, and don’t be afraid to file lawsuits against everyone who dupes you. There’s extreme Life altering consequences, that ensue when you overpay for a house, and get duped by Sellers, and Realtors. 

There’s all sorts of stuff I won’t waste time getting into, like the seller has prior knowledge of a development going up that’s gonna end up changing the value of the home, or screw up the drinking water. There’s so many factors. Once you own a home and get screwed, you know what to do and what not to do, and the realtors treat you entirely different. You’re pretty much gonna get screwed buying your first home, especially because a Boomer and older Gen X is selling it to you, and they want ridiculous prices to fund their retirements, and get a nice big jackpot for themselves, off of your backs, and hard labor.

I personally won’t buy until the last boomer is dead. I think the market is gonna crash and everyone buying right now is gonna be screwed like after the 2008 Crash. I seen it happen already, and it always happens when Baby Boomers Sell their houses in droves. They collectively collude and run up the market for top dollar, and then it crashes for the next guy, because the local incomes can’t sustain the prices paid. Avoid buying if you can is my advice.

1blbk20,2024-03-22 22:05:14,Apparently I (30M) have the professional reputation of being a family man/family oriented. Sad that it’s a distinguishing quality instead of the norm. ,"I’m in house counsel at a large corporation. I left private practice when my sons were 1yo because I realized my career as an M&A attorney at a law firm was not compatible with my desire to put family first and be an active and present father. I realized I didn’t want the life the partners had and so I decided to go in house. 

My firm understood and even commended me for making that decision. When I interviewed for my current role I made it clear that family was my priority and apparently the C-level executive of my team appreciated that a lot and it was a big part of me getting the job. 

Recently I’ve had several colleagues bring up in passing that my reputation is that I am family focused and some have shared that others said the same to them about me. My manager shared that that is the reputation I have and said it’s not the norm for men in our industry so it sets me apart. She acknowledged that many employers would not look positivley on that but our company and especially our team very much does. 

A former colleague from my old firm reached out today for advice and a referral to my company, and highlighted the fact that my move in house was to focus on family and expressed approval of that. I’d never spoken to him about my move so I take it this is my reputation at my old firm too. 

It’s wild to me though that the fact that I put my family first is a distinguishing factor. I know lawyers have the reputation of being workaholic absentee dad’s but with our generation I’d hoped this improved.

I just realized there’s this sub too because I’m in the one with another n called r/Millennials

Also, about the description of the sub, if you grew up just before 2020, so 2019, then yeah that’s the last of Millennials if you mean 25 years of age

But 2002 borns who turned 18 in 2020 are for sure Gen Z and a few years younger than the last possible Zillennial year, nvm Millennial

Also, I obviously remember Barack Obama and I’m legit in the core of Gen Z (2004). I literally voted for him in the fake election we had in Pre-K class

But yeah the other stuff makes sense though although you can remember Bush being President without being a Millennial and maybe even being Gen Z

Like if I payed attention to the current President in the end of his term when I was newly 4 years old, then I would actually remember Bush despite being at least 10 years younger than you guys

So even a 2005 born could definitely remember that at 3 years old. That also means a 2013 born could remember the end of Obama despite being late(r) Zalpha leaning Alpha

But yeah obviously I know that it means you easily remember all of those things, not the tail end of one of the extra ones that’s actually a Gen Z thing or a Young Millennial teenage-young adult thing and I’m just overthinking some slight things at the very end of that list

So yeah Ig some of those events in the sub description are probably from the late 1990s and almost everyone born in the first half of the 1990s should remember them, and they just added Bush and Obama just for the sake of it.

So the fed government just authorized a $5.8b student loan forgiveness for 78,000 borrowers.  Which IMO is a drop in the bucket for over $1.7T and 43,000,000 borrowers total.  Previous attempts have faced way too much resistance from Republicans to do anything meaningful about it, and considering all the corruption in politics, a spending bill of that magnitude is simply too hard to pass.

So my thought and I am sure many other have the same.   Why not just eliminate the bankruptcy immunity for student loans?  I think it would be much easier to pass, since that should have been illegal in the first place.  The banks have already made so much money already on student loans this should be tolerated by banks.  Philosophically student loans should be treated like every other loan.  I get the lack of collateral thing, but they just need to bake that into the terms, without a lifetime of debt slavery.

Capitalistic governments have chosen to worship ""Profit"" as the ultimate good, and the corporate appetite for infinite growth has left a very few very rich, and the rest of us struggling. 

None of this is new news. 

With AI, things seem even more scary. If these guys can automate, automation, then where exactly does that leave us?

I submit that the only way to combat this will be to vote with our wallets. The otherside of AI is that people are given the power to utilize it too. Someone who is highly creative, but lacks skills in accounting can now open up a business with AI helping them with their weaknesses. In the same vein, a small team of 5 can now do the work of a much larger workforce, and compete with big players in their industry. 

True, we don't live in a true capitalist system. We live in a state sponsored one, meaning that any time big banks, or fortune 500 companies fail they get bailed out, unlike us. Politicians don't seem interested in helping, votes don't seem to matter all that much, and we can forget about help from the state itself. 

The only way the people can get any semblance of power back is by determining how they will spend their money.

Eventually AI will enable us to create entire films, disrupt entire industries, revolutionize non-profits. AI is truly comparable to the advent of electricity. However just like electricity, it's only as good as what we use it for.

1bjuhen,2024-03-21 01:23:50,I've Managed To Repair My Relationship With Alcohol (Long Rambling Post Ahead),"This is gonna get long and rambling, and if you make it to the end, I really appreciate it.

I’ll start with the background. was born paraplegic and grew up being really sheltered by a verbally, emotionally, and psychologically abusive parent. When I first started drinking at 21, I had an enjoyable, moderate relationship with alcohol. I was able to easily leave alcohol at the table, was focused on the flavor, rarely ever got drunk, and prioritized the other people and experiences in my life. 

When I was 22, I made a mistake. In retrospect, it wasn't that big of a mistake. No one died, no one was injured, nothing illegal happened, I had this one class that I needed to pass not just to graduate, but to even start my major. It was math, I have a math learning disability, and the campus was so wheelchair inaccessible that I was self-tutoring myself for pretty much every class I took. I failed; and not just a little bit. I mean less than 50%. This, I didn't blame myself for. However, I knew that when I went home no one would listen to me when I said I did my best, and I would be blamed. I was terrified, and didn't know what to do. So when I got to my apartment I got drunk, played video games, and ordered pizza. I had *never* done that before, but I was so scared and at the time, didn't have the mental health tools to really with it. 

When the pizza guy got there, he decided that he was uncomfortable with a guy in a wheelchair being drunk, and called 911. When I tried to explain to the EMTs that I was able to handle myself, no one listened and I was dragged out of my apartment to the hospital. 

My dad and my older brother had reactions that I thought were pretty fair. Basically, “Look, we’re not saying that this was a *good* moment for you, and please don't do this again, but people your age do much dumber things every single day in college and are never held accountable. *we* did worse every day, and were never held accountable. You got drunk in your own apartment *once*, and you were dragged to the hospital and humiliated.” at this point though, my mom was the one around most of the time, and for months straight she yelled at me about how much I embarrassed her. Sure enough, she blamed the school thing on me too and told me I was lazy.

From then on, I felt like I had to prove that I could handle my alcohol. Which I tried to do by drinking WAY too much and trying to handle myself. Of course, that's not how body chemistry or biology works. This was followed by a long period of abstinence because I didn't trust myself.

Long story short, at 30 I'm back to that healthy relationship I had at 22. This and my fitness/self-care routine are the two biggest accomplishments I’ve gotten since COVID-19, and I'm really proud of myself. 

Again, if you've made it this far I  really appreciate you.

I tend to fall more in the first camp, but the second camp seems to think that since the world is perfectly fine in their minds, they can't understand why on earth anyone would complain about the current status quo or why we *on average* don't do as well as generations past.  I don't have all the statistics memorized off the top of the dome, but I think there's a misconception amongst this crowd that we're all out here saying our lives are ruined.  I disagree; I think most of us are just acknowledging our reality and trying to make the best of it.  The ""quit complaining"" crowd is so terribly disingenuous and argues in bad faith so often that I really don't believe most of it is legitimate.  I'd be willing to bet that most of these posters:

* Are grossly exaggerating their career successes
* Are grossly exaggerating the level of adversity/challenges they've faced in life
* Are Gen Xers or Boomers posting as if they're millenials
* Don't live in this country

The rest either fall into one of two groups:  Oblivious to the world around them and genuinely believe what they're saying OR they understand the game is rigged, but it works for them, so they have no interest in changing it (i. e. the Tim Scott, Milo Yiannopolous, Nikki Haley types).

If you want to complain about the status quo, complain.  Don't let anyone push back against your experiences, they're most likely just trying to shut you up and push their own agenda.

If you truly think everything is fine and your fellow millenials are just complainers, do what I do when I see a stupid, asinine thread that makes no sense to me:  Don't engage, and scroll past.  It's very simple.

What I’m finding is after years and years of taking my lumps, late nights , sleepless weekends of grueling work to get ahead all of the sudden companies have decided to grow a consciouse and demand better hours for their workers.

That’s great I think except the squeeze is still there and who does it fall on now? Not the lower grunt workers, Gen Z has spoken their mind.

Instead as deadlines approach and demands are made we cannot expect the younger gen to rise to the challenge at the risk of getting blowback. But at the end of the day the quality and the integrity of the final product falls squarely on my shoulders, which essentially leaves me getting stuck with the bill once again on projects. Having to again, work late nights and weekends to make up for the lack of additional help despite the high bar that is demanded to be met.

Companies are desperately trying to maintain optics that they are ethically driven to provide better hours while collectively not actually doing anything to fix the bottom line. They sweep it under the rug.

1bilnwd,2024-03-19 14:31:42,Possible unpopular opinion: I think our collective expectations in life are too high,"Just for context I'm 30F, single, working multiple jobs, and from a lower middle class family. This post isn't meant to be a deep dive into the intricate economic and governmental issues in the United States, just sharing my thoughts and obeservations. Also, this post obviously doesn't apply to everyone, I'm speaking generally. 

Everywhere you turn on the internet, there are complaints about the state of the country. Grocery prices, interest rates, home prices, the cost of school, you name it.

While there are a plethora of things to genuinely complain about, sometimes I feel that millenials and the generations after us have wild expectations about what life should look like. They make a lot of comparisons between us and generations before. Such as our parents/grandparents generations owned homes, took vacations, had 5 kids, and didn't have the struggles we have today.

But it seems that we are failing to realize that life has always been a struggle. Sure, my parents owned a home in their mid-30's but it was an old twin home/duplex that was less than 1,000 sq. ft. for the 4 of us. We had Christmas presents, but we never got Nintendos, Razor scooters, or American Girl dolls like the rich kids did. I've had exactly one invite-your-friends-from-school birthday party in my life (a bowling alley in elementary school), and our vacations consisted of one trip to the beach 45 minutes from my house where we stayed in a rundown motel for 5 days.

The things we currently expect in our daily lives were special treats in the past. Eating takeout or at a restaurant, coffee shop lattes, certain snacks and cereals from the grocery store, and shopping in general. I wore my sister's hand-me-downs or got new clothes from K-Mart layaway once a year before school started. My first car was a 20 year old Ford Escort that I paid someone $800 for with a speedometer that maxed out at about 80mph. When I first moved out on my own I would check my bank balance on my phone while I was waiting in checkout lines to make sure I could afford what I was buying. If I couldn't, I put it back. I didn't charge it to a credit card.

Our grandparents had 5 kids but they lived in a run down home with 3 tiny bedrooms. They'd make big pots of grits or oats to feed their family. They'd eat almost-expired meat by tossing it into a beef stew, or made liver and onions for dinner. Our grandparents bought one set of furniture when they got married and kept it for 50 years. Our parents got married at a VFW with artificial flower bouqets and disposable cameras on the tables.

The moral of the story is: These days we expect to live in 3,000 sq. ft. homes, have new cars, have the latest phone upgrade, always be updating our home decor/furniture, throw our kids Instagram-worthy birthday parties, take family Disneyland trips every year, have all the streaming services, shop at Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, have lavish dream weddings, AND have the disposable income to blow at Target while we sip on our Starbucks.

Listen, I'm over here paying almost $2,000 for a one bedroom apartment right now. I'm single, I'm working multiple jobs, and I don't have a wealthy family to fall back on. I get it - it's hard.

I understand that there is much to complain about, but it's always been that way. People, especially families, have always struggled. It wasn't abnormal for people to work 2-3 jobs and still barely pay the bills. It wasn't abnormal to struggle to afford groceries. These are not new concepts that started with us. Our parents and grandparents couldn't afford the types of luxuries that many people feel entitled to today. Many families of the past were ALSO one emergency away from being broke. Not just us.

Whether it was a war, the Depression, or the 2008 housing crisis - there has ALWAYS been some major factor affecting the general public and the economy. So when I see people talking about what they SHOULD have because ""our parents did"", it gets under my skin a little bit. We want houses but many aren't willing to live in small, old homes that need some TLC like our parents owned. We poo-poo the houses with 90's oak cabniets and formica counters, and complain when things look outdated.

I just feel that we collectively need to take a few history lessons to look back at how people have always lived. I'm not saying we shouldn't strive for improvement, but I also think a lot of people need a reality check. We have access to so many luxuries, resources, and conveniences that our grandparents could only dream of. Yet we are here complaining that those luxuries and conveniences are too expensive. Everyone wants the biggest and best of everything but also say they don't want to work 40 hours a week. Unfortunately that just isn't how it works. That's never been how it works. You sort of have to choose one or the other: luxury or less time working. Unless you come from wealth, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

I just get frustrated with the lack of gratitude I see all the time. Life is hard but I also recognize that it's a privilege to be alive during these times. Even during the pandemic, we still made out significantly better than generations past did during major world crises. Like I said, this won't apply to everyone, but jeez can we all just have a big fat slice of humble pie once in a while?",928,291,0.62,millenials,13,Tuesday,Afternoon

I don't understand why some redditor deep in the dunning kruger Kool-Aid think it's intellectually contradictory or limiting to be religious.   


 The dialogue between science and religion is not about proving one right over the other, but understanding how they illuminate different aspects of the human experience. It's about exploring how leading figures in science have navigated these waters, integrating their faith with their work in ways that propel them to the forefront of discovery and innovation.   


 Why is it then, that discussions often veer towards division rather than exploration of this intersection?

 couple years ago i had a really piss ass terrible time that came out of nowhere. maybe this is just a natural evolution of our lives? the business man who buys the fancy car.... its in every movie, book, tv show... suppose i never really though of it as a 'real; thing.

i lived a pretty isolated life - no dating, minimal friends. as mom had taught - lower profile and just more on my own.  late 20's/early 30s was when i found really true close friends - started rekindling friendships from my school days as well.  always felt i had time to do whatever... i was never emotional, never effected by strife, always stoic and calm.

well i hit late 30's and something clicked. i had no idea what... id met a woman that didn't work out so i thought it was that at first, then other unfulfilled dreams maybe... it threw me into a dark and shit place. total mental breakdown level of chaos in my life that came with inability to sleep and serious physical manifestations.

my life changed a great deal when i stopped holding myself to ideals id learned as a young adult. suppose i reached a fuck it stage... on the back-end of this breakdown i started opening up, exploring life, one might say i started living.  ive spent more time partying, bars, clubs, raves, conventions.. .more gf's, cuddle buddies, close friends in the past year and a half than ive had in my entire life...  i decided to build my life more as i wanted - gaming/movie theater in my living room, tools for projects in the garage. just a path that is far more focused on what i enjoy.

after these experiences and now a solid chunk of time past my struggles i have come to realize it was the isolation that broke me. when i have friends and groups of people - im happy. if i stay inside and just stay to myself i do not feel well.  a very abrupt and total 180 from ive felt at any other time in my life.

maybe an unrealized manifestation at suppressed emotions/desires? who knows. life has a way of surprising us, even after decades lived. ",187,101,0.89,millenials,27,Monday,Afternoon

Like by “middle age” your default status in the eyes of this current society is “pathetic until proven impressive,” and impressiveness usually just means having authority over anyone else at all, even if it’s just a kid you made. That’s pretty fucking weird honestly. Why aren’t we just impressed when someone’s happy and nice.""

The stock market is where the rich have all their money.  literally all of it besides real estate. The stock market is basicly a measure of who is wealthy and who is not.  if you look through the graphs, people of color dont own stock, and theyre all broke.  young people dont own stock, and theyre all broke.  Its all held by old white people, and guess where all the money is?.

 College is a debt trap that keeps you from investing.  Dont get caught, work the hard high paying jobs that everyone else our age complains about and wont touch with a 20 foot pole. 

Heres the forumla to not be like every broke ass millenial.

1. Work hard AF, 2-3 Jobs, hustle anything you can to earn extra.  This is why the first 100k is the hardest because you have to work with your back for it.  Dont be ashamed, take the hard job, work 80-100 hours a week, if you ever want to escape poverty this is the only way.
2. Be cheap, live cheap as u can, and Dump every penny into the market concistently for years.
3. Once you make some decent gains in the market, BUY REAL ESTATE.  but keep money rolling in the market for your next leg up.

you will end up like the old rich white guys.

Within 90 seconds of me starting to talk about these things, she prescribed me 10mg of Lexapro and (?mg) of Ambien.

She asked me basically zero questions. 

I was having trouble sleeping because my sleeping environment was crap, and once I made some major changes, I'm sleeping better. The depression and anxiety was partially because I was exhausted, partially because I had just gotten my ass kicked at a job I didn't enjoy, and partially because of a developing family situation. And after 6 months of tests on my heart, it turns out to be fine, it was just anxiety about my heart (which can be cured by finding out you're fine) 

Now I'm sleeping better, my heart is fine, I don't work at that job anymore though I'm kinda still recovering. They were really despicable. And the family thing has gotten worse but also not as demanding so I can ignore it most days.

It's the reason why facebook, boeing, activision blizzard, and every other large company that was once great, now sucks more and more as time goes on. 

Then, last night, I got home from a trip to tired to make dinner and grabbed McDonalds from nearby. I noticed something about the chicken nuggets (aside from them being $5 more expensive than the last time i bought Mcdicks) ...

They suck. Like, they're not the chicken nuggets they were 6 years ago. They are ""airy"" and mushy. The chicken has no substance or texture. It's like they ground up chicken nuggets, then added 25% filler of some kind, like just maybe flour or cornmeal. 

Has anyone else noticed this?",30,32,0.86,millenials,5,Tuesday,Afternoon

1bc7zxv,2024-03-11 16:55:40,Are things actually that bad for millennials or do we just hear a chronically online vocal minority?,"There was a thread on here earlier making it seem like most millennials are screwed financially, and the ones who are doing fine are only doing well cause their parents have money. In my peer group, that's definitely not true. I know people who didn't come from money and are doing great because they thought outside of the box and figured out how to capitalize on the way society is changing. i know people who did come from wealthy families and are struggling because they squandered the opportunities they did have. And of course people who are doing well because they had a head start and people who would be doing better if they did have a head start.

Ya, life's unfair like that, no argument from me here. We should try to make it better from everyone. But it seems to me like it's a spectrum, kinda like it's always been. I just don't think things are ever so black and white. I really can't help but feel like things aren't actually THAT bad and it's just a biased sample of people we're hearing from.

EDIT: wow, based on the way things have gone in this sub before, I was not expecting the majority of comments would agree with me. Like I said, things aren't fair and I'm completely open minded to anything that makes them a little better for everyone. That said I felt like I was going a little crazy with people online *insiting* things were terrible but when I looked around I saw they weren't that bad. Almost like I was being gaslit by that chronic-online minority into thinking I was completely screwed and I shouldn't even try to make my situation better. Crab bucket mentality, as they say. It's really refreshing to see I'm not the only one who's noticed this and thinks this way.

EDIT 2: This really did blow up, and after reading all of your comments, my conclusion is that it's a little bit of both. Like things are getting worse in some ways (and better in others), but there is a sampling bias towards people who aren't taking responsibility for their own lives. This has got me thinking that this is like ""the boy who cried wolf"" situation, when you complain about everything, people stop paying attention and won't listen to you when you talk about something that is actually a problem. I also have to say that I'm disappointed but not entirely surprised at the immaturity of some of the responders.

Financially, living at home is my only option in my area at the moment. Privacy is at a premium, and of course I want to be as respectful to my family as possible. 

The only experience I have with this was a few years ago, and the relationship wasn’t long (for other reasons), so I don’t feel like I got a good sense of dating while living at home. 

I feel like it’s a turn-off when I say I live at home. Is dating (and everything that comes with it) realistically feasible when one or both people live at home? What sort of toll does it take over time (if it takes one)? How do you feel if someone says they live at home when you’re initially getting to know them?

I lived on my own during college and it was so easy to date knowing that I could easily have someone at my house and not disturb anyone else.

1bbm0sw,2024-03-10 21:43:48,'Criminal for existing’: US’s unhoused still fear sweeps as supreme court to take on shelter case,"A few highlights from [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/01/homeless-supreme-court-case) everyone should read. This effects everyone no matter how well off you currently are.

🔘 ' Next come the police officers, chaperoning other city workers and giving encampment residents an hour to collect their belongings. Whatever they can’t carry or transport goes into the trash compactor.

“You start trying to prioritize what you need,” said Freeway, who has been on the receiving end of too many sweeps to count. “You try to pull yourself together and figure out what’s important. And the entire time you’re doing this, there’s a good chance the police officers are going to harass or antagonize you. ” '

🔘 ' Encampment sweeps like these can destroy a person’s shelter, transportation, vital medicine, important documents and treasured, irreplaceable heirlooms. Bulldozers can crush pets or even neighbors who dont’t get out of their tents in time. They shatter support systems that have been cultivated during the camp’s existence, another round of state dehumanization. '

🔘 ' Rather than spending money on getting people housed, communities spent money on attorneys to figure out how to continue doing the same thing, but in a constitutional way.

Multiple sources said that municipalities have been known to leave one or two shelter beds open – or simply add an extra “bed” in a cramped space like a closet or storage area – for the explicit purpose of allowing cities to continue sweeps.

Other attempts by cities to skirt the new requirements have been more brazen. In 2021, following a lawsuit over ordinance enforcement in Chico, California, when there weren’t enough shelter beds, the city tried to pass off “an asphalt tarmac without a roof, walls, water, or electricity” as adequate shelter. A court eventually rejected this attempt. '

🔘 ' ""There’s this term ‘service-resistant’ that a lot of cities have been using to criminalize folks further.. [snip]..That you’re choosing to be houseless, that you’re no longer unhoused because of systemic circumstances. 

But in reality, the services they’re offering just recycle people through programs, and they get to make a little money off our bodies until we’re returned to the streets, more houseless than we were when we first went in.”

The systems of capitalism cannot resolve the homelessness problem because they directly benefit from poverty. If people were properly fed and housed we would have a different economy and political system. We wouldn't provide half ass homeless shelters that's not an accident. We wouldn't dehumanize and criminalize the working class or the impoverished.

Maybe this is just my bias, but I feel like if you were born after me, it's a stretch to say you largely grew up before cellphones/internet. 

By the time I was around my freshman/sophomore years in high school, it was already to the point where at least one friend you were with likely had a cellphone. To be sure, at this time (around 2002) it was still common to be out somewhere with friends and no one had a phone, but this was phased out pretty quickly. 

Internet culture wasn't quite the same as there was no social media yet. But AIM, message boards, and internet humor were a pretty dominant social force. 

I guess what I'm saying is, it was already kind of a mixed bag for me in this regard and I was already 3 years old by 1990.

1b905iz,2024-03-07 17:23:15,Why Millennials Should Advocate for a Higher Minimum Wage in the United States,"Hey fellow Millennials,

I wanted to spark a discussion about something that affects many of us directly: the minimum wage in the United States. As we all know, the current minimum wage is simply not enough to support a decent standard of living, especially considering the rising costs of housing, healthcare, education, and other essentials.

Here are a few reasons why I believe we should advocate for a higher minimum wage:

1. **Cost of Living**: The cost of living has skyrocketed over the years, but the minimum wage has failed to keep up. In many places, it's nearly impossible to afford rent, groceries, and other basic necessities on the current minimum wage.
2. **Income Inequality**: The gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen, and a higher minimum wage can help mitigate this problem. By increasing the minimum wage, we can ensure that everyone earns a fair and livable wage, reducing income inequality in the process.
3. **Economic Stimulus**: Contrary to what some may believe, raising the minimum wage can actually stimulate the economy. When low-wage workers earn more, they tend to spend more, boosting demand for goods and services and ultimately benefiting businesses.
4. **Dignity of Work**: Every job deserves to be compensated fairly. No one should have to work multiple jobs or rely on government assistance just to make ends meet. A higher minimum wage would reflect the dignity and value of all types of work.
5. **Health and Well-being**: Financial stress can take a toll on our mental and physical health. By ensuring that all workers earn a living wage, we can improve the overall well-being of individuals and families across the country.

Of course, there are counterarguments to consider, such as concerns about potential job loss or increased prices for goods and services. However, numerous studies have shown that the benefits of raising the minimum wage far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

As Millennials, we have the power to advocate for change. Let's use our voices to push for a higher minimum wage and create a more just and equitable society for ourselves and future generations.

What are your thoughts on this issue? Do you believe that the minimum wage should be higher in the United States? Let's discuss!",373,193,0.72,millenials,13,Thursday,Evening

Take a slow look at this image. For a moment, disregard anything she did or did not say and just look at the image. 

I believe this is a very consciously and carefully curated image that is intended to send a message to young women, particularly White suburban millennial women. Again, for just a moment, do not think about what she said, but think about the setting, the staging, the hair and make-up and wardrobe. This image is intended to sell you on a lifestyle. 

What do you think the lifestyle is that the image trying to sell to you? 

Does it work for you? 

Are you attracted to the lifestyle being sold in this image?

(Again, only consider the curated image.)

1b3keus,2024-03-01 03:36:40,What will millennial aesthetic be remembered for?,"Basically zoomers are 100% going to be remembered for the men all growing mushroom bowlcut sand the women all cosplaying like it’s 1998.   Frumpy jeans and frizzy bowls is pretty much SET IN STONE for gen-z.  But how do you reckon millennials will be membered?  

To me as an 87 model I think there’s a notable schism in millennial aesthetics.  Basically there was the constant trend that’s been happening since industrialization where whatever was popular ~30 years cycles through again as the people that were toddlers then are now in control of the industry and set out to recreate the nostalgia from their pre-pubescence.  That’s seen in the 00s-10s trend where we basically cycled through the 70s-80s, particularly with male hair fashion and other stuff.  But then at the same time there was the kind-of-novel thing going on where, on top of the standard 30-year-cultural-echo, there was a kind of inexplicable 100-year-cultural-echo as the “hipster” movement took hold and everyone started cutting their hair like 1910s fascists and wearing Clark’s WW1 boots and generally replicating like late-1890s Switzerland fashion.  

Basically to me, with hindsight, the peak millennial fashion was a relatively-novel mishmash of the standard “whatever was cool 30 years ago is cool now” industrialization meme, combined with the somewhat-absurd obsession with like 1900s-1940s ‘hipster” aesthetics that really kind of jumbled things up and basically set up the lay-up for zoomers to stumble into the middle-parted curly bowlcuts that my mom made me get when I was a moronic 6-year-old with no agency.   I feel bad for zoomers tbh.  There’s never been a time in history where the bowlcut wasn’t looked at as a fucking joke for the 90% of human aesthetic appreciation time that is spent absolutely mocking that fashion.  

Like nobody makes fun of the shaggy 70s look. It went out fashion in the 80s and 20s but it never stopped being cool.   No matter when you look at a picture of a rugged-70s aesthetic man, they’re always kinda rad.  Compare that to how people look back at the mid-90s and right now when bowl cuts hit their peak.  Nobody is proud of their 1990s bowl cut pics, and nobody will look back and be proud of their 2020s bowlcut pics.  And for that, I’m kinda thankful that I’m not a zoomer.  Yeah the hipster shit was kind of embarrassing, but in 200 years the 1920s aesthetic will still be cooler than the 1990s aesthetic.  We made the right call leaning into looking like the Hitler youth and not going full bowl cut.  We will be remembered like the lost/greatest generation and zoomers are doomed to forever be seen as neo-boomers.",43,20,0.81,millenials,7,Friday,Night

I see so much clearer now and am able to feel my emotions for what they actually are - identify them and at least have an opportunity to work on them. If there’s anyone out there struggling like I did for 15 years with failed relationships, just unhappy and unsure why, thoughts of hopelessness and no energy — highly recommend giving sobriety a shot — it’s not easier, it’s just better.

Basically they (Canadian Parliament) is going to be voting on passing a new Bill that would carry hefty fines (70k+) and possible life in prison for ""Hate Speech"".

Problem is they don't define what is ""Hate Speech"" the term has changed / evolved quite a bit over the past 5-10 yrs, so what happens when it is defined by the Government is my question..

They say its to protect Kids from bullying online (great in theory) but its so vague with what they are using to describe things and it seems so open to interpretation but that would be defined by the Government. So its very weird reading this Bill (and the vagueness of the terms) since it would give Government total control of what is and isn't acceptable at any given time which seems pretty fascist when you think about it..

idk maybe I'm wrong here? also they keep saying over and over how its to protect kids and all that (really hammering this point) but shouldnt parents have that right? This just seems like something out of a Movie / Book like 1984 and that sorta thing",5,3,0.8,millenials,6,Wednesday,Morning

1b0qmpv,2024-02-26 19:43:21,The Time Traveler's Guide to NOT Getting Caught,"Hi All, Millenial here, sorry if this post annoys you.  I've always loved history because it's basically the story of us, our species throughout time. One of my favorite things to do is think of historical hypotheticals and imagine a different possible world, so I wrote a time traveling book series and converted it into an audio version. It's called The Time Traveler's Guide to NOT Getting Caught, and it's about a self-centered 25-year-old guy who finds a time traveling watch behind a dumpster, and then he goes back in time and has the craziest, most selfish adventures you can imagine. In the story, he winds up facing several time traveling paradoxes, like when his future self comes back in time to hang out with him. And also, he travels back to relive the glorious 90s.  

This isn't your typical time traveling story, it's like Drunk History meets Hot Tub Time Machine. In the first book, the time traveler goes back to colonial America where he accidentally almost kills a founding father, visits Ancient Athens in search of an epic orgy only to wind up kissing Socrates, and gets trapped on the Titanic as it hits an iceberg. He also meets Isaac Newton, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, Davy Crockett, and many more.

The first season is already completely produced (which will have 19 episodes), with new episodes released Thursdays at 8. Seasons 2-4 are already written and in the process of being recorded, so there will be plenty of content. We made this podcast because we realized there's a lot of miserable things happening in the world today, and we all could use a little more levity. There aren't any ads, we just want to make people laugh.

Most of my family and friends are great with their kids and social situations, but I have lots of acquaintances who seem to have no boundaries with their kids. By that I mean bringing children to social events that are by nature adult (think nice sit down dinner hosted by a friend, non-children friendly parties, and lunches that meant to catch up as busy adults) without request or question. Another example is breweries where I have often seen children racing around, running into people, and screaming like it’s a playground. Is this a new cultural norm? Granted I grew up in a generation that saw children told sternly to play in the play room and let the adults talk. I get childcare issues and I am not at all opposed to the inclusion of children in any BBQs, picnics, parties that are clearly family friendly. I understand absolutely the issue of childcare, but why do many not check in to ask or assume that their children are welcome at any venue? Or don’t monitor them to make sure that they don’t take it over (brewery example). I’m honestly curious if I’m off base here. ",163,17,0.56,millenials,2,Saturday,Morning

Do you think it's become less common to do that or was it always uncommon?","When I was a kid, it was pretty common for my dad to pick what we watched, and it would sometimes be something from the 60's or 70's. The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Happy Days, Batman '66, the Smurfs and the whole Hanna Barbera library.  Didn't bother me one bit and to this day I think I still mostly watch older media, even if I haven't got an ounce of nostalgia for it, i'm really starting to get a taste for 70's horror.  Hell, a good chunk of my favorite movies aren't even in color, they're from the 30's and 50's.

But I've noticed a trend for younger generations to almost completely write off anything older than they are except for maybe a handful of Disney Movies and tell me that i'm nostalgia blind for liking older media, even though it's 1. Stuff from before I was born, and 2. I'm also enjoying stuff i've never watched before in 2024.  Hell, my own nephews won't watch a classic Looney Tunes short but they loved the new ones on HBO Max even though they're not that different outside of being animated digitally.

So I just want to know, did it used to be more common for people to enjoy things from before their time and this new wave of writing off older media  is just a newer thing for more recent generations, or was I just weird because I'm watching old ass shows and playing old ass games I didn't grow up with?

EDIT:  I was not factoring music into this because I live under a rock in that regard.  I can see you all have a lot of experience with younger people enjoying older movies.  I guess it's just my own experiences,  It seems more common with video games than it does with TV and movies to completely write off the old stuff, but I do see some insane takes about movies being bad just by virtue of being old.",27,30,0.95,millenials,47,Saturday,Night

I just remember thinking how cool it was to talk to someone from what’s basically a different world at that age. It was such an unusual experience at the time; my folks weren’t loaded but they saw how important computer literacy was going to be and I was one of the first people in my graduating class to have one.  It was a Gateway.  Not sure why this is popping into my head at this particular time in my life, with things the way they are.  it feels… significant maybe.

Anyway, does anyone else have any cool stories from your early days talking to strangers around the world when the internet was just for nerds?

edit: Hey guys, I am already blown away by all the great stories.  This really helped me deal with some difficult feelings.

as a teenager i was a late bloomer and socially behind but i also never really thought about my body as negative or positive, i barely thought about it or noticed it. in college i was drinking a lot and thought my body was changing and i was gaining weight (looking back i think i may have gained like 1 or 2 lbs lmfao) and for the first time was looking at my body critically and became obsessed with my looks and would spent hours pinching my stomach and analyzing it and researching how to eat healthy and exercize etc and basically had some disordered eating issues and ocd but i kind of just got over it. now i just try to eat healthyish and try and walk a much as i can, that time period was exhausting and it's wild that some people are constantly hyperaware of their bodies since they were kids, i couldn't handle that.

is anyone else in the same boat of like... body neutrality?",32,8,0.6,millenials,9,Tuesday,Night

Musk is still quite certain those Optimus humanoids from Tesla will be ready for mass production and sale in 2027, and of course, he thinks everyone should have a humanoid living with them at their house.

He's hoping they'll only be about $20k each, which is actually quite cheap if you ask me.  

Am I just getting old here, or does anyone else think this is a terrible idea?  Are the younger generations all excited about this and can't wait to buy their own personal Johnny 5 to be friends with and to do their bidding?  

I'm wondering whether or not I should get another dog, let alone some super intelligent and super strong artificial intelligent humanoid that doesn't have emotions and doesn't sleep or eat.  Call me old fashioned, but I'll happily take care of the laundry myself.

Do all these people who are so excited for our AI future not remember how human nature works, or something?  Within a week they'll be hacked and we'll have humanoids running around the streets, robbing banks, hijacking high-end cars, selling drugs, conducting gang hits and political assassainations, and so on.

And while I'm ranting, so who exactly decided that it was absolutely imperative we have computers that are more intelligent than humans?  And not just a little more intelligent, but vastly more intelligent to a degree we can't really comprehend.  And not just decide for themselves, but for all of humanity, now and forever in the future.

I don't know about you, but I never got my voter card in tthe mail for this decision.  This is why I don't like people like Sam Altman, and I'm a software engineer myself.  How big of a self important, pretentious asshole do you have to be to think so highly of yourself that you're capable of unilaterally making such a decision?

But, then the world is so fckn chaotic right now, I’ve been OBSESSED with watching the news, and donating to causes, and posting to my social media.   However, things don’t appear to materially change, Palestinians are still being blown to pieces as I type this, kids in the Congo are still digging for minerals in dire conditions, people in Sudan are still experiencing a famine, thousands of Africans every day are drowning when trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, and their bodies washing off on shores…I could go on and on. It all just stays with me every day.     

I become aware of the world around at such an early age that I understood the dysfunction in my household really quick.  Ever since, I’ve been wanting to make a positive impact. 

Fast forward to now, ’m successful in my life with a home, and a well paying job. I volunteer , I donate, I recycle, I educate myself on issues. I even went vegan, but I feel like it’s all pointless.

Sure, I take acid reflux meds daily now and just looking at pizza will give me heartburn, but that's a one off. My left shoulder is a little fucked.

We live near my husband’s parents who own three properties (one is a rental in the Bay Area, one is rural land, and the other is a 50-acre homestead they retired on). 

My husband’s parents were helped their entire life by their own parents. Allowed to rent a family home in the Bay well below market rates for 20 years. Had a grandmother next door as a built in babysitter. Trust fund every year. Inheritance check. 

My husband and I are struggling to get by physically, emotionally, and financially, yet they don’t want to extend that generational help that they received, to us. I’ve asked if we could put a tiny home on their 50 acres to help with my husband’s care as he progresses, it was a no. I’ve asked if they could supplement his loss of income while he’s filling for the long and painful permanent disability process, it was a no. Asked if we could rent the house from them (that they rented) for under market rate, it was a no. 

How can I get his parents to see the help they received from their own parents (for accidentally getting pregnant), is the help we need as chronically ill millennials?

Many would call me a late bloomer. I finally finished college after 10 years on and off at a local state school. I spent 4-5 years at community college where I obtained my associate’s degree. I then earned my bachelor’s in business administration from a local state school 13 years ago, with a GPA of 2.3. I worked in retail and fast food before finding a solid job at a warehouse and now finally being an operations manager, making $98,000 a year. Two years ago, at the age of 38, I bought a 4-bedroom house with a basement and 3.5 bathrooms. Finally, when I purchased a home, my parents and family, especially my father, wanted me to get married. Initially, I said no, but they found a girl that I ended up really liking. She was 24, and we both agreed to marry each other in an arranged marriage. After being engaged for 3 months, I fell in love with her, and we got married last year. I was almost 39, and she was 25. Now, after a year of marriage, my wife and I want to try and have a baby.

I’m also worried because my wife and I have been having unprotected sexual intercourse since our wedding night when we had sex for the first time and consummated our marriage and lost our virginity to each other, and are now hoping to conceive. However, due to my ADHD and financial struggles and poverty growing up thanks to my parents, and especially my dad my credit has been impacted. I’m concerned that I won’t be a better father than my own father. What if I'm too old and won't be alive when my kid graduates high school and college and also I want at least 2 children and so does my wife...

Also my parents are both 71-72 living with me and my wife and I take care of them and my mother already said how she will be here to help as much as she can same as my father but I don’t know.",53,1,0.52,millenials,16,Sunday,Night

1an9z7p,2024-02-10 06:31:27,As a millenial who loves to camp now - how the heck did I survive sleepovers on bedroom floors/field trips as a kid!? Share your sleepover shenanigans here!,"All of my favorite sleepover memories as a kid - whether it was spending a night at my cousins playing Crash Bandicoot till we passed out or the time my boyscout troop slept out in an exhibit hall at the museum of science have one thing in common. A child sized sleeping bag that probably cost $20 (mine was Disney's 101 Dalmations) - MAYBE a pillow.

My memories of the few family camping trips we took as kids always include waking up absolutely freezing - usually with a tree root lodged firmly in my sacrum on bumpy ground. I remember my first sleepover birthday party in 5th grade with a dozen of us sleeping in a friends basement on the cement floor using whatever we could as bedding - I was under a 12x12"" throw pillow as my blanket with my shoes as a pillow.

It is a funny thought to me now who needs an inflatable air mattress with 3.4 R value and 800 fill 23degree mummy bag to even hope for a few hours of shut-eye if I am camping. I even sprung for a packable pillow to really treat myself.  At home I gotta have at least a full size mattress with 3"" memory foam topper, Casper pillow, another pillow under my feet, sheets can't feel too weird and eye covers have become essential in the last couple years.

I was particularly baffled while cleaning out our attic last month and finding 2 old school Coleman sleeping pads which seemed like they were late 80s/early 90s....this technology existed this entire time and I was out there raw dogging the floor/earth in a Disney bodybag!? 

The memory was unlocked for me when mom and I visited that very same Museum of Science earlier this week and she was like ""yup - that's where your sister and I slept on her Girlscout field trip, right over there by the moon lander...Maggie Shanahan threw up on your sister in the middle of the night and then I needed back surgery two months later from sleeping on the floor""

I worked at camps the last few years and these kids get dropped off with Tempurpedic memory foam and duvets and shit and I'm like wtf! What happened to sleeping with a rock in your rib like the good old days!?

However, the rest of the kitchen is always a mess because there is nowhere to put anything. I suggested putting the dinnerware in a heavy duty tub and putting it in storage since they never use them. But her response was that they will get broken and that the cabinet is protecting the sets. 

To me, this makes no sense to me. Why keep like 50ish plates that you never use in a cabinet taking up space while using paper plates for food each day and then complain that theres nowhere to put things? They haven't hosted dinner at their house for years due to the mess as well. I told my parents that if my brother doesnt want them when i inherit them, they are going in the trash.

1ahutwr,2024-02-03 12:15:26,People are off their rockers about kids and technology,"Been reviewing this sub and seen a lot of posts about mellinial parenting with kids and technology. I have to say everyone here is absolutely nuts and almost comically so. ""The kids are glued to screens!!!"" It's a cliche in the making and it happens everytime. In the past video game consoles were supposed to destroy the children and lead to the violent destabilization of society, before that? Having their own phone!, before that? Television!, before that? Radio! Before that? Jazz music! Before that? Easily accessible alchohol!

I could go on another 100 years but it's all culture war BS here's a new flash that every generation needs to hear. Your kids are not going to grow up to be you or be like the kids you grew up with.

They arent playing with toys because toy stores like toys r us went out of business, they aren't watching Arthur or hey Arnold when they get home from school because it isn't subbed, McDonald's isn't a cheap eat for the whole family filled with playplaces for them to play in and you almost certainly are not taking them to exciting locations like Disneyland every year.

You have to foster the things they are interested in and make their world not yours a wonderful adventure. If you're worried about where society is going then you need to vote.

The us education system isn't cripled by parents or electronics it's crippled by the average American who decided to stay home on election day. Don't want schools dictated by fire arm drills? Then vote and get a godamn weapons ban passed. Don't want teachers fleeing schools in droves? Then vote to get everyone a living wage and to empower unions. Want mom(or dad) to stay home and play with the kids? Then vote and make godamn maternity(paternity)leave, subsidized day care, or a meaningful child tax credit a real thing.

The problems not the parenting it's that too many butts are glued to the fence of apathy. 

I'm going to end my rant with a poem by Khalil Gibran

     Your children are not your children.
     They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
     They come through you but not from you,
     And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.

     You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
     For they have their own thoughts.
     You may house their bodies but not their souls,
     For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
     You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
     For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
     You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
     The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
     Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
     For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable



Edit: I don't have time to respond to or read every comment here and there are certainly a lot of rational folks here with reasonable opinions but there is also a lot that concerns me.

I honestly hope this subreddit is not representative of my generation because the amount of you commenting who have learned nothing from the mistakes of the past is shockingly high.

Honestly people commenting here are as out of touch as the previous generations that they complain about. So many are quick to blame technology and change just because things are different from their own childhood. 

I have seen many people commenting here certain that children are up a creek because of their access to technology, or because of trans rights, or video games, ECT... 

But inequality, lack of healthcare, lack of funding, and easy access to guns just fly right under the radar of most of the people commenting here. 

My only take away has been that if the comments of this place are in fact representative of my generation then unfortunately the next generation will inherit all of these issues. All while we whine on the sidelines about how the poor shouldn't be permitted to be parents or that childrens phone usage is turning them braindead and unable to read or that they have become socially stunted and don't use the right bathroom!

The shortsightedness is deafening, I just hope it's isolated.

Second edit 

This part I just have to share for irony's sake. The number of people linking studies that they say definitively proves electronics drastically damage learning, reading, socialization, and ECT...   When the studies actually do no such thing and go out of their way to say so pointing out they have no causal association and frequently rely on self reporting is really high and it is deliciously funny. The irony of someone linking studies arguing illiteracy that they didn't read...

But if you are fed up by the powerlessness you face, then stand firm against it and move forward with all your heart and soul. If you have nothing to lose, then try to lose it. 

Always stick to non-violence, but aside from that, you have the right to choose to break whatever laws you deem fit. When the law goes only one way, there is no law. 

I call everybody to stop supporting a system that assaults us, steals from us, and bends us into submission. Makes us its tools against our own well-being. Make it known if you do not stand for it. This is about every issue that has come and gone. Every issue that has been brought to light and conveniently forgotten. Make it known. 

A country that refuses to use the law to protect the common people, and instead uses it to enrich and protect our oppressors, has lost the privilege of our support. 

And if you are fine with the direction of the world, of the country, of economic prospects and realities, of the ruling by faceless entities and wealthy elites, then do nothing. If you are satisfied that your ballot is enough, and that it has been working as intended, then do nothing. You have chosen your side. 

Just remember who you cooperate with, and who you stand against. Inaction is action itself. As Ghandi also said, “Noncooperation with evil is as much a duty as cooperation with good.”

Unfortunately companies today don’t really offer pensions anymore. I’ve read several times that there won’t be any social security for us when we get near retirement age. It will have run out before then. We’re paying into today’s social security benefit receivers while we get the shaft come retirement. And that’s assuming if most millennials will ever even be able to retire.  

Sky high housing costs, high mortgage rates, they keep wondering why people aren’t having children as much anymore. When the cost of rent and food DOUBLES in just a few years, what the fuck do they expect?! SHIT COST TOO MUCH!",609,209,0.71,millenials,6,Monday,Night

My teens and early 20s were spent trying to recover from trauma a severe eating disorder,  and I did manage to mostly do that. 
When I was in my mid 20s I worked for a big company in FL that many dream of working for. Originally the plan was to work for them in a more professional role and have a ""good"" career doing something I loved. I was finally going to get ahead and I was determined! I moved across the country and I was going to do it!

However, my social anxiety and anxiety in general got the better of me as I worked for the big dream company in a minimum wage-ish job (more like 4 dollars above minimum wage but still unliveable) and could only afford low class apartment living, literally living with roaches. I could hardly manage part time hours due to my anxiety and my partner worked full time and even with our joint income we struggled and had to continually ask one of his parents to help me ends meet. 

Then 2020 hit. We lost our jobs. Then a hurricane  hit, and our apartment flooded. Worse, they informed us after the water was cleaned up, our rent was going to rise 300$ a month. The whole situation was traumatic.

We ended up having to leave the state and move back to my hometown and now have been living in his mom's basement for the last year.
He finally got a job, paying 65k a year but after taxes, only 49k a year... and he's highly skilled with a bachelors degree. 
I feel like we're never going to get ahead. I also hold a bachelor's but haven't been able to get a job. I know that's negative thinking but the last ten years of my life, where have they even gone?!

I need a job I can work remotely because of my anxiety. All this high paying jobs requiring you to be 5 people and do 3 peoples jobs.. I'm just not cut out for it and I feel devastated and like a failure.

And the thing is I'm so tired.
 We have no savings, no 401k, and I feel like all of the dreams I've had for my life have disappeared. I have nightmares about the hurricane and just the lack life ahead of me. 
I don't even know why I'm posting this, I just don't have friends my own age and I'm just hoping someone can relate or something. Thanks for listening.",9,20,0.88,millenials,17,Monday,Night

1aclax0,2024-01-27 21:18:57,50% of American Boomers have less than $100k in Retirement. 50% of American Homeless are Boomers.,"I learned recently that half of all American Boomers have less than $100k in retirement savings left and that 50% of the homeless population in America are Boomers. Which cuts into the myths that all Boomers are living high on the hog. 

I do find this interesting though. A few years back I never could have fathomed that the most greedy and selfish generation in American history would have HALF its populations in dire straits during MY lifetime. 

They happily invited that Spawn of Satan Ronald Reagan to dismantle every program and institution that was the backbone and safety net of the American worker. They voted for him with glee. As he chanted ""Greed is Good."" They cheered him on as he decimated entire communities deemed ""undesirable"" by the majority. They cheered for him as he cut funding to everything that enriched and improved the lives of Americans. All for this same generation to now represent 50% of the homeless. Only for HALF of this same generation to be unprepared for retirement. 

They didn't just screw future generations. They screwed themselves. Apparently there ARE swift consequences for our actions.

EDIT: I want to revise one small part of this post (I can't change the title). The number was 45% of the current homeless population is Boomers. The link to where I learned this information is below:

I’m in the opposite boat. My parents are both are pretty clear in the fact that they will not be helping me raise any grandkids, and are not interested in the idea of being grandparents. 

I’m recently married and my husband (and his parents, who are the best in laws ever) really want kids/grandkids. To them, having kids is just what you do and an essential part of life. Quite the revelation to me. I wasn’t sure until recently if I even wanted kids, but now I think I do. My birth was an accident, not even a planned pregnancy. My dad is re-married with a second family and my mom does not want to be a grandparent. She didn’t have a great relationship with her parents and neither did I, so I understand her just wanting the trauma cycle to end. 

I guess I’m just struggling with the idea of becoming a parent and feeling very alone with no extended family support except for his parents who live in a different state.

Again, it's a branding and marketing thing.

Whereas Boomers were fed propaganda about ""the self made man"" and accomplishing things on their own (which led to most boomers having no idea how any system they inherited works)

Gen X was designed to rage against the system but then self implode with the enormity of what it means to topple and empire

Gen Y was designed to come next and to question the existence of the fabric of reality and society, and given that the Boomers do not know how anything works, society was supposed to mostly crumble when Gen Y decided it was all bullshit and fairytales.  They cut the program early because it turned out asking ""Why"" leads people to understanding, and many of us learned things about the system Boomers and Gen X still do not understand.  For this reason, they cut over early to Miley Cyrus and the millennial program which are based on nihilism and narcissism.

I would’ve considered it, but the ongoing images/videos coming out of Palestine are simply too much to bear for me. I cannot believe my hard-earned tax dollars are funding a genocide. I’ve become a staunch anti-Zionist as a result. 

The more I learned about the brutal occupation, daily humiliation, the Nakba, the organ harvesting, the siege, the blockade, the desecration of graves, the fact that everything coming into Gaza should be approved, that their water, electricity, food are all controlled. 

I was a Bernie guy, but even him was a disappointment. As I look around and talk to millennial friends, most don’t even want to be bothered with voting at all.

She ALWAYS made sure all my siblings got our mail-in ballots each time election cycle. 

FYI, I’m genuinely asking…So, please, no need for the vote shaming…As I do not particularly care. 
I’m neither a “bot”, russian, or trying to influence anyone to vote any which way, and have NEVER voted Republican in my life. But again, whatever floats your boat.

As a progressive, the concept of voting for the “lesser of 2 evils” AKA harm reduction has never appealed to me. Also, if a democracy is at stakes every 4 years, then do we indeed have a democracy to begin with?
The fear mongering by the Dems is so tired. I do not think they truly understand the general displeasure with Biden (at least in my community). 

I acknowledge that this may be a privileged decision as my life wasn’t necessarily impacted by the previous Trump presidency…and I do pretty good for myself overall.

I don't know, there may be advantages to using artificial intelligence, but I only know many disadvantages, which are:

\-Plagiarism (since at my time plagiarism was less serious or depending on the degree, we did not have artificial intelligence, the artificial intelligence we had was ""google"");

\-Get test answers;

\-Losing a job or being replaced by machines during employment, whether during hiring progress and other factors;

 \-Robbery schemes;

 \-Suspension at school;

\-And among other factors.

With these disadvantages, I don't know if I should trust artificial intelligence and if I should use it for good and not for bad use and why has ChatGPT grown a lot in recent years and doesn't it seem scary?

**Edit:** thanks all so much for replying. there's so much replies and I could not reply to everyone individually, but here is some things:

* this topic is controversial. 170 replies and only 20 upvotes.
* /r/Millennials subscribers are an american bunch. almost all replies came from the States.
* I am shocked as a northern European that Racism is still such a blatant and systemic issue in your country. (Editedit - yes there is a lot of systemic racism too in Europe, and one is not better than the other, i'm not pointing fingers)
* However, I mean the racism that was still there until the 1960's/MLK/Rosa Parks. I think **y'all should be start calling it Apartheid**, because that is what it literally is. Racism is too unspecific and downplaying it. it is an 1. Active 2. Systemic 3. discrimination on race 4. of multiple groups. Thats just bad and evil and of course the USA is seeing the consquences of that in more personalized racism nowadays. [also check this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/millenials/comments/194wk3s/comment/khp2cxv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
* until now, here is a theory: it seems that the post broadband internet-era (y2k and beyond) has dispersed culture much more in the states, it became more the same instead of North vs South:
   * The north became more outwardly racist - but the tensions were already there in 90's but more faux pas to speak about, so that was ""the irony"" of calling asians slant-eyes or spicks etc. as ""jokes""
   * The south was extremely racist, and continues to be so, but maybe Is really influenced by all the BLM things, maybe a few less people say N\* a few less times and that is change, people. change is very slow so please be optimistic. propaganda works! there will be always more young kids that are like "" screw this, i'm leaving this place"" when there are those pamphlets around them about race, gender, etc than there would be when there is none
* Gay Bashing was real. I feel for everyone being abused that way. it maybe was a remnant of puritan values from waaaay back? at least, the whole 9/11 thing and leaving  George Bush and ""family values""  behind seems to have hugely turned that over culturally for the better, so thats a good thing. too bad it also brought Trump. 
* please go to therapy people! Change comes from within and our generation has witnessed and experienced a lot that was not ok. there are 180 replies currently of abuse in this thread, simply because you were born in that era doesnt make it better. all the love!

**I'll bite of the bullet:**

When I was a kid, in a middle sized city in the Netherlands:

* Lots of fighting but especially a looot agression
* Lots of racist jokes about minorities, out in the open
* lots of bullying, controlling and/or toxic behaviours

all this was out in the open, both by fellow kids and adults. even more bizarre: it was completely accepted.

 I've experienced firsthand the challenges and complexities of our legal  and political systems. That's why I founded Just Liberty Incorporated  and developed two transformative platforms: Just Legal and Just  Politics. 

&#x200B;

**Just Legal**: Demystifying the Legal System

&#x200B;

* **Innovative Legal Flowchart Software**: Guides users through various legal processes interactively, simplifying legal jargon and procedures.
* **User-Friendly and Secure**: Prioritizes accessibility and security, making legal navigation intuitive and safeguarding user data.
* **Versatile for Various Legal Scenarios**: Whether it's criminal, family, civil, or other legal matters, Just Legal provides comprehensive assistance.
* **Advanced Conversational AI**: Helps users understand their legal situation, draft documents, and advocate for their rights.
* **Comprehensive Legal Assistant**: Tracks cases, offers legal options, and provides resources for informed decision-making.
* **100% Free Service**: Ensuring access to legal help for everyone, regardless of financial constraints.
* **Continuous Enhancement**: Adapting to emerging technologies to meet the evolving needs of society.

&#x200B;

**Just Politics**: Engaging Voters with Value-Based Questioning

* **Deep Dive into Individual Values**: Tailors information to each user's beliefs and priorities for a personalized experience.
* **Balanced Overview of Candidates and Issues**: Offers unbiased pros and cons, empowering voters to make informed decisions.
* **Citizen-Driven Lobbying**: Democratizes lobbying, allowing users to advocate for policy changes effectively.
* **Real-Time Expenditure Tracking**: Brings transparency to government spending at all levels.
* **Secure Voting Mechanisms**: Ensures the integrity and accuracy of the electoral process.
* **Enhanced Community Engagement**: Facilitates dialogue and collaborative action within communities.
* **Educational Content and Resources**: Provides knowledge to demystify complex political topics.
* **Blockchain Technology**: Implements blockchain for an immutable public record, transparency in voting, and financial tracking.

&#x200B;

Both Just Legal and Just Politics are more than tools; they are movements towards a future where everyone is empowered and informed in their legal and political journeys. I invite you to join this revolution and help us bring these modern solutions to our modern problems.

&#x200B;

Your support, whether as developers, programmers, blockchain experts, volunteers, influencers, or donors, is invaluable in bringing these platforms to life. Visit [truejust.org](http://truejust.org/) to learn more and become a part of this transformative journey.

191m0jc,2024-01-08 14:07:59,What sincere advice would you give Generation Z?,"For all the grousing that gets done on this subreddit, I feel we have something to offer those of us with more road ahead of them.  I mean, our formative adult years got 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, COVID, and an attempt to storm the U.S. Capitol.  We've seen some stuff, we've gotten through some stuff.  If you had a Gen Z captive audience, where you could say ""Look, this is some of what's coming, here's what you gotta know and gotta execute on,"" what would you tell 'em?

For me, and in no particular order: 

1. **Have a plan, identify concrete steps towards accomplishing it, and be brutal in your self-assessment and on the in-between steps.**  The world is just too fast-paced these days to float through your 20s and beyond and still come out on the other end reasonably close to where you want to be in terms of life goals, finances, etc.  Unfortunately, that means identifying your personal win condition real early and sacrificing over the long term to get from A to B.  Assume that the cavalry is not coming to your rescue.  Either curl up in a ball or get moving.  Your win condition may change with time, but always be moving towards it, whatever it is.
2. **Know your budget down cold**. Half the battle in the lean years is knowing what number you have to set aside each month. Half the battle in later years is making sure lifestyle creep doesn't happen. 
3. **401k/RothIRA/TSP**. You max out that match for the free money. That is as essential as your rent payment.
4. **Your raises are not all yours to spend**. Somewhere between 20-50% of your future salary increases go to savings. By all means use some of it on the daily to make life more enjoyable, but you're playing the long game. It sucks up front, but it sure feels good later when backbreaking emergencies for others are just annoyances for you.
5. **Remember that, for all this, you are not your job**.  Even if you're one of those high-achiever types, there will come a point where you will stop working.  Don't just be a drone.
6. **Car**. If you managed to buy one back when car loans were at 2% interest, congratulations. If you need a car, get a used Chevy Cruze or equivalent, or if determined to buy new, a Kia Sentra or VW Jetta. Regardless, you are getting a compact with good fuel efficiency and it is now your car for the next 10-15 years unless your life situation materially improves before then. If you can avoid 7 years of car payments, that's about $25,000 you are not spending so some piece of metal can sit in a parking lot most of the day.
7. **Live close to work as is reasonable.**  You have roughly 16 waking hours each day.  You're going to lose at 8-9 of them to work, and another hour to morning and evening routine.  Of the remaining 6 hours or so left, do you really want to spend a third of that driving, and paying all that gas?  If you can nab a telework job, that is like *gold*, particularly if you're looking to start a family.
8. **7+ hours of sleep is non-negotiable.**  Yes, you can power through no problem, but the difference between being serviceable and being rested starts becoming much bigger in your 30s.  Start now, feel better and younger longer.
9. **Learn to cook well**. Especially if you're the type that likes to eat out a lot. Less expensive, useful skill to have, and you have full control of the menu.
10. **Booze and drugs.** Stay away from 'em. I've seen (and represented) too many people who threw away their future and their families due to liquor or edibles.
11. **Know the difference between fact and opinion, and how much weight to put in one or the other.**  Feelings are excellent gap fillers. They are opinions based on the sum total of your experiences and instincts.  They help you make decisions with incomplete information.  They do not get to supplant reality.  Similarly, just because someone has the same opinion as you does not mean you're both right.

I just finished the book All This Could Be Different by Sarah Thankam Mathews. Description below:

&#x200B;

Graduating into the long maw of an American recession, Sneha is one of the fortunate ones. She’s moved to Milwaukee for an entry-level corporate job that, grueling as it may be, is the key that unlocks every door: she can pick up the tab at dinner with her new friend Tig, get her college buddy Thom hired alongside her, and send money to her parents back in India. She begins dating women—soon developing a burning crush on Marina, a beguiling and beautiful dancer who always seems just out of reach.

But before long, trouble arrives. Painful secrets rear their heads; jobs go off the rails; evictions loom. Sneha struggles to be truly close and open with anybody, even as her friendships deepen, even as she throws herself headlong into a dizzying romance with Marina. It’s then that Tig begins to draw up a radical solution to their problems, hoping to save them all.

&#x200B;

It was a wonderful read. Published in 2022. As a millennial who graduated college in 2009, it did such a great job of characterizing the uncertainty of coming of age in that time period and how difficult it was just to make ends meet. The main character also has the added challenge of being an immigrant, but the whole novel took me back to that period of time in my life, both the good and the bad.

Can't recommend it enough and thought other millenials who had a similar experience struggling to find their way after college or just in general would enjoy it. It's extremely well-written and it's you know, a tad early, but I suspect it will be one of my favorites of the year even in 11 months.",0,9,0.91,millenials,19,Monday,Afternoon

For some reason, they believe they built the world they grew and thrived in. We know the history. We know their parents and grand daddies fought the Nazis, built the rockets, and then piloted these rockets.  


They? They applauded when the rockets were shut down. And the education became primarily a business.

&#x200B;

I don't expect them to know this. Nor I should. You shouldn't for certain. 

&#x200B;

The world is shit. I'm still not dead yet. And thankfully I'm not senile yet.   


I think we can still do something. Maybe not fix everything. But at least, for ourselves, soften the impact a bit.

I posted my story and got WAY more messages about women suffering the same fate than I would have expected. Of course, we are demystifying what used to be kept hush hush (my grandmother told me she referred to her two miscarriages that ended with a D&C “dusting and cleaning”). But I also can’t help but to believe with the increasing amount of chemicals and environmental pollution, we may just be the most infertile generation and those of us who desperately seek children are just unable to have them.",565,690,0.89,millenials,8,Friday,Afternoon

I’m aware that black women are already at a disadvantage in the dating world in Atlanta 😅. Even in church, I catch myself sometimes scoping around every now and then…but it seems that all the men there are already spoken for.

I just want to know if there are single men out there who actually do attend church. Maybe knowing that there is a portion of men who do go, will give me a sliver of hope to potentially meet a nice guy in this setting.

18myjox,2023-12-20 16:25:22,Is distrusting my employer a generational trait?,"So I got a letter today offering me 20000 “units”, which seem to be class b shares, of the private equity firm that owns my company. My instinct is that they’re trying to push some sort of company debt or something off on me. I distrust it and want to reject it, in spite of the possible future benefit that owning these shares may give me. 

So talking to other folks around my age (42) or younger they all would immediately distrust it. I admit that I don’t know enough about how that sort of thing works, but I was given a little insight into it. My gut reaction remains, however, that the company is doing this because it’s good for THEM, not for me. They could very much care less about me or my well being, they want profit and revenue. How would it benefit the company to give me these things freely and without me asking. If I was happy with my compensation, not that I am but I never said anything, why would they just do this unless it benefited the company above all else. 

Older folks seem to just be like “it’s probably fine”. So I don’t know. Seems like at a certain point we learned to distrust employers.

Edit: I have real reason to distrust them. When I was hired they changed part of my compensation package without telling me, hiding it behind a vague name. When they promoted me this year, they told me they would do two things out loud that didn’t manifest. So there’s been lies from them already. ",16,15,0.8,millenials,7,Wednesday,Afternoon

18m45jz,2023-12-19 15:12:09,AMERICAN INDIVIDUALISN IS A SCAM,"I am referring to that BS about kicking kids out of the household at 18.


Thing has never been any more of a scam.


Reading history about the rest of the world, it's easy to see why there are big cities filled with sardine can multi-story buildings, while America is filled with downthrodden mutil-family buildings.


Not gonna sugar coat it. The past was bulshit too. Many of the Boomers were not the result of a mutual agreement between Grandpa and Grandma. But the result of a drunkard and another person without a say in the event that followed. 


Also, family ""traditions"" allowed for a lot of shit to happen and be kicked under the rug.


But, economically speaking, there was a bonus.


One couple would start a household. Have kids. Then, the kids grow up. 


That's where things kickstart.


Instead of living the household, the new grown-ups get a partner. Then, start adding up to the initial small house of the original couple. Instead of starting up small, from literal zero, each new couple can now focus on making wealth.


Instead of the elderly getting unable to handle more and more tasks as time passes, they get additional workforce from their second and third generations.


Mothers have problems taking care of children? Grandma and siblings aid in childcare. No problem going to school or work.


Men have to learn household maintenance, as the property is collectively owned. So each one better learn how to fix things and build things.


There is no need for retirement homes or nursing homes. The elderly has the protection and companionship of their own family.


Sure, there has to be order. Abusive, problematic (thievery, scam, vandalism) or aggressive members should not be allowed in the household.

18ly7j0,2023-12-19 09:47:21,Getting the most bang for your buck in the kitchen,"Merry holidays everyone.  I just wanted to discuss maybe looking at the kitchen differently if you are having struggles with groceries.  These are my tips that work for me.  I am a single female no kids.  I hope to also maybe see if you have advice of your own that I might incorporate into my routine.  

Starting off the christmas gift I got myself was groceries.  Though I made it a point to stock my kitchen well with staples and spices.  I went out and bought flavors I normally don’t buy so I can taste other things.  Example would be getting agave nectar instead of maple syrup.  I got egg nog for my coffee instead of milk. 

I have stopped buying perishables and fresh veggies that I know will spoil if I don’t use them quickly enough.  For me that would be like a bag of spinach when I might just want a cup of spinach. 

So my actual refrigerator is pretty barren in terms of items. I keep things like eggs, salad dressing, cheese, yogurt.  Things that will keep long shelf life.  I also only use the front visual depth of my fridge.  Things never get pushed back.  Keep your fridge shallow so there is less waste.  

I keep a bucket full of rice probably about 25 lbs worth.  Today when I went Christmas cubbard stock shopping I bought noodles of different color, quinoa, flax seed, a gallon sized quacker oats.  I always have an abundance of oatmeal instead of granola.  Stock up on pasta and grain alternatives. 

I stocked up on banana bread, cake mix, brownie mix, etc.  so when I feel like something sweet I’m not wasting money on an abundance of junk food and I can at least commit to baking something delicious with minimal hassle. 

For veggies I buy the assembled pre made bags in the frozen section and use ziplock bags to portion out a quart size of veggies. Essentially breaking down each package into grabbable meal sized single portions.  I can defrost it for later or grab it for dinner and microwave at work.  Same with meat.  

I buy meat that I might not need now.  Sandwich meat, plethora of chicken or hamburger.  Again break it down into single portion sizes or make 2 meals. I buy good bacon if it’s on sale buy one get one or buy one get half off.  My point is if it’s something you don’t need now.  Buy it anyway and stock it for later.  I freeze my yogurt, cheeses, sandwich meat, bread for later.  Take out of freezer when you need it. 

Splurge and buy spices and sauces.  I might have the same sausage and broccoli but it tastes different depending on the sauces I am using.  I also don’t leave my spices in the back of the cabinet to die.  I have a basket and about 40 ziploc bags of spices I take down when I cook.  I just pinch my dry spices out of the ziploc when I need it.  They don’t stay in plastic bottles where I can’t access them. 

I spent about 230 today.  It will keep my staples stocked for at least 3 months.  When I shop every week to 2 weeks I spend about 60. Because I’m just buying bread, milk, dog food, tortillas, yogurt.  Really just replacement staples.  

I also shop the perimeter of my store.  Less processed foods.  I buy deals / bogos.  Sometimes higher end grocery stores will have things nearing expiration. I make about 12 bucks an hour.  I’m never starving though  or seeking to eat out. 

Example: I just cooked eggs with toast, shredded bag cheese with salt pepper but I used coconut oil for a flavor change because I bought it buy one get one.  I also just sided it with Greek yogurt because I have 3 in my freezer but added a bit of banana and agave nectar. 

I started keeping a loose lazy food journal in my sketch book where I rate my random combos.  I’m to lazy for complex recipes. Sometimes I make random combos I will want to make later. 

TLDR : stock up your kitchen with staples.  Buy more and freeze.  Portion control.  Most of your money should be aimed at good spices and sauces so you don’t feel food poor.  The refrigerator is where things go to die and be wasted. Keep the fridge shallow. More dry goods. More frozen. ",1,6,0.88,millenials,10,Tuesday,Morning
18kzh0p,2023-12-18 03:50:07,Millenials are a chill generation,"To be honest, I feel millenials are somewhat more mature in a lot of subjects than a lot of other generation. 

Less tendencies to extremism, generally anti-censorship but understand decency, calm and open to constructive discussions. They have environment at heart, and generally had a great time partying and having fun growing. 

Not only this, but I feel they understand the importance of not taking things too seriously, prefering social harmony to imposing ideas on everyone.

I feel generation X lose their temper quickly, and that Z don't want to listen to different opinions. 

Maybe it is just my perception, maybe it is only my area, but each time I met someone of my generation, I generally get along with that person, wathever our race, origin or sexual orientation. 

I am sure that it is not like that everywhere, but I find it really common.

But for me, like damn, something about the pandemic seems to have just unlocked some people's crazy and they have never gone back. 

I had a cousin in the UK who, in her 20s, went from atheism to full on Muslim, married and pregnant within a year and some change. Her mother became a vehement COVID denier and tried to visit my dad who was recovering from cancer WHILE SHE HAD COVID. We haven't spoken since. 

One of my oldest friends started unapologetically defending nazis present at the freedom convoy here in Canada and has gone full anti-vaxx, anti-lockdown...and he's an educator. :/

Another seems to have had their breaking point from the Israel/Palestine conflict and refuses to even entertain the idea that what Israel is doing to Palestinians might be bad. Like she is legit calling for blood, and she's not even Israeli! And she's studying to be a therapist!

Still *another* found a husband online during the pandemic who got her into shrooms and now she writes long blog posts about how what we really needed to cure COVID was the power of hugs and human connection (despite that y'know, being the very thing that was killing and disabling people during the pandemic). 

Other than these examples, a lot of my friendships are also just...fizzling out. And I get it, I'm in my mid 30s and people have kids and lives. But it feels like before the pandemic there were at least attempts for us all to keep each other in our lives. It just seems gone now. Everyone seems exhausted and miserable. And I include myself in that, too. Sometimes it feels like a herculean effort to try and get something started. 

As I write this, I'm sitting here on my PC tonight missing the MSN days.

Mine literally couldnt provide us with food, school supplies, housing and clothing adaquately and often times chose things like drugs and hoarding over providing for us. My husbands parents are considered upper middle class, refused to pay for his college out of pocket and had him sign parent plus loans to go to school, went on international vacations sometimes yearly, and continue to this day to live out of their means and his dad's $1,000,000 severence package (was paid out in like 2018-19) at this point will not support them to the end with how they spend. Meanwhile, my kids never suffer from how much we struggle. They are always provided for and while we are not homeowners (due to this terrible economy) we do okay. However our boomer parents continue to always try and put their 2 cents in about how we handle finances they know nothing about, nor do they take the time to understand the economic predicament millenials are in to try and relate. Just exhausted myself having a conversation with my mother about sending my son's teacher (our age too) classroom supplies/snacks and she could not comprehend that teachers are expected to pay that out of pocket bc that is not how school was for her.

They’re now partnered with ID.me, a third party company who verifies and authenticates identities. In order to successfully submit a payment to them, it’s now required for you to submit photo of your driver’s license along with entering other personal information.

My question is this: Why is this necessary? Not like the government doesn’t have access to that information already. What really sketches me out, is that in the terms and conditions, you’re giving ID.me permission to share your personal information. They use this third party site to help “prevent” fraud - which is a bunch of baby back bullshit. If anything, this site seems more susceptible to fraud. Nobody actually knows where or who this information is being shared to, but if we don’t accept these terms and not pay the IRS, our bank accounts will be levied. Seems like another one of the governments shiesty schemes and the innocent people fall victim to it once again. 

Oh and almost forgot to mention, if you accept these terms and set up a payment plan like I did because you don’t want your bank account levied and because we cannot simply live without money - be prepared to pay an astronomical amount of interest!! 

I always found it ironic that the IRS can take their sweet time when it comes to paying you back money that’s owed (also interest free), yet when you owe them, they demand it immediately with a knife to your throat. And if you can’t pay them right away, they charge an arm and leg in interest or freeze your assets. 

I’m a father of two, soon to be three, struggling in this capitalistic society.

Combined zoomers and millennials constitute a majority, add in x'ers and its an overwhelming majority. We could effectively form a voting block along generational lines. 

Are you psyched for the upcoming election? Do really think it actually matters who gets elected president? This is what I'm proposing: young people write in some kind of politically neutral public figure, such as Nick Offerman (the guy from parks and rec), for every elected office they can. We continue to do this for every state and federal level election until student loans are forgiven and social security is phased out or until Nick Offerman becomes elected the president of the united states.

16o4fwt,2023-09-21 02:48:56,Parenting my parents: concerns over my mom's excessive screen time,"Hi everyone, this post is going to be about parenting one's own parents. To preface, I am an eldest child in my family and a woman in my mid twenties. My parents are also immigrants. Lately, I have become more and more concerned about my mother's excessive screen time on her iPad. Usually, you hear talk about screen time regarding the excessive usage among children. But screen addiction/excessive screen use can happen to anyone. In this case, my mom is an iPad adult and is glued to the screen first thing in the morning and immediately after coming back from work. A YouTube video is on during dinner time. It is on the table while the rest of my family is eating and trying to engage in conversation with her. Her favorite app is YouTube, and I am noticing that the kinds of videos she is watching/videos that the algorithm is now feeding her are really mind numbing and...childish? It will be really clickbait-y stuff about police apprehending a ""criminal"" or a  luxury shopping haul or a mukbang or a family vlog channel. I understand it's okay to consume this stuff in moderation, and I do it as well, but this type of idiotic content is taking over her life for hours on end. She has become less social, more irritable, and totally unwilling to go to events in the city or places in my neighborhood, such as the park. In addition, I noticed that the content she is watching is really getting to her brain. She can no longer speak in complete sentences and when she does, she regurgitates an idiotic talking point that reinforces a worldview that is racist, sexist, homophobic, or pro-cop. I can tell that it makes her fearful of the world and encourages her to spend more time holed up inside. This is really scary because the alt-right pipeline on social media is very real.

I bring up the fact that my mom is an immigrant because it adds context to show that the rest of her social life is really lacking. She has no adult friends that she hangs out with--at all. She has some family members she keeps in contact with via the phone and social media, but this really has dwindled when my aunt (her closest confidant) died about ten years ago. She only has my dad to socialize with. Her relationship with me is also strained as she never has emotionally matured. So I think that perhaps her excessive screen time is a way to get socialization done, except that this is only happening online and with no back and forth between her and anyone else. I am trying to drag her to the library but she has no interest. Her attention span is wired to click on clickbait (""I just spent one million dollars on a Tesla! \*shock emoji\*"" kind of stuff).

Today, I went into her iPad and set a YouTube screen time limit for eight hours because she was home all day due to having the day off. She reached that cap at about 3pm, but opened YouTube on her phone right after and kept watching. After always being ridiculed for being an angsty teen who was constantly texting, seeing this amount of screen time from her was shocking, but depressing mainly. As much as I am raising this issue out of me being in shock or fearful that she'd fall into the pipeline, this situation is depressing most of all because it shows that she has no real friends or hobbies. She is also possibly depressed, but as an immigrant from elsewhere she believes that mental illness is nonsense (and that I just don't have the willpower to overcome the depression that I am medicated for). I am fearful of what her future might look like when she retires and my siblings and I aren't there to socially engage with her each day. I want to sign her up for classes or events where she can socialize with other adults but she absolutely refuses to go, she evidently has social anxiety. I feel like the roles have reversed and I have become her parent -- it is frustrating and concerning and I just don't know what the fuck to do with her.

I tried r/venting and r/relationship_advice but my posts keep getting removed for one reason or another and I just need to let this out of my body.

I'm 35, she's 33. We've been dating for three years.

 I take home $3.8k/month after taxes. She makes about the same. I've got at least three years left on *one* of my student loans.  I've also got about $27k in debt on one credit card, and about $14k split on 2 care credit cards. Aggressively... I could knock these out in a few years via snowball and complete conservation/focus and perhaps with promotions it could be quicker. 3 years I speculate (without promotion etc).

Full breakdown:

- 1200 rent
- 200 electric (its hot here, but also my girlfriend insists our apartment is below 70 degrees.)
- 100 water/sewer
- 230 phone bill
- 470 studen loan
- 240 care credit
- 210 care credit
- 500 credit card
- 60 internet bill

She pays for the car/insurance and groceries (about $300/m) and then gives me an additional $500/month. It comes out to about the same.

3 years to crawl out.. even the total debut doesnt sound terrible.. but it's extremely difficult for me to stay within budget. And that puts me at 38 and her at 35 respectively. That's IF the next three years were extremely restricted... and honestly we don't even have a single month of that kind of accountability or responsibility.

Out of the money I have left after bills every month I try to keep my spending to $300 every two weeks and hopefully save $500 every month. That hasn't happened. There is always something that she wants to do or that I end up paying for that just isn't In the budget.

This allows me basically to get us dinner and a few drinks at the bar one night- with maybe a few snacks during that two week time. Gas for the car. 

My girlfriend and I pretty much have everything split... except she doesn't have debt and her paychecks are starting to rival and exceed mine.  She knows our money situation.. but it's difficult when she wants to go on dates etc and I cannot provide for any of this and remain on a budget.

We want to get married. Have children. Get a house. She's looking at houses that are like $400k... I'm thinking that is not a possibility for a good 5-10 years... if ever.. and that's if we are really focused on that goal. I mention this and she becomes all sad and is like *""do you really think it will take that long""* 😥😥 Average wedding is like $30k... neither of us come from money or have any money saved. Not to mention a ring... 

33 is beginning to be geriatric level for having a baby.. and honestly I can't forsee affording a baby for at least another year or two at best. I'd prefer to get married first as well but honestly that just pushes the whole operation down the line another year or so.

I think I've waited too long to make these corrections to my debt. I love my girlfriend- and I know she loves me too- but I know we both want those things I've talked about above and it's just a heavy weight to manage and rationalize and plan. 

Between the stress of her asking for dates and going out and spending all this money on whatever... meanwhile she has no debt. I dunno. 

I know what I have to do to get clear but it's going to take time and focus and she wants my time and gets angry when I try and work on this future. There is a lot of sacrifice involved. A lot. 

Not only that but she begged for us to get into this nicer apartment.. where now I'm paying like $400 more than I was a year ago... it's hard managing this shit. I know *I would be fine* living in a cheaper apartment for the time being... but she has all these conditions.

 I quit smoking recently and just can't seem to fucking deal. She wants to buy marijuana often- and i have wanted to quit for ahwile... just realign.. focus.. not spend money on that. Since she buys though she makes me feel bad when i dont participate in one of the 10 times she smokes a day. I could also cut drinking out but I realize she wants to get out of the apartment (we both work from home.)

I love my girlfriend but I don't know if I can provide for her and achieve those goals within a decent time frame. I want her to have the opportunity to have those things. Its hard getting on the same page and setting a budget. I feel like maybe I'm slowing her down or that she isn't able to commit to the sacrifice that I think is necessary for us to achieve these goals... or at least... the sacrifice I need to do in order to achieve these goals.",8,2,0.58,millenials,17,Tuesday,Night

16isomh,2023-09-14 20:17:30,What do you think about Joe Rogan?,"As a millennial , Joe Rogan was a big part of my life in formative years. When I was teen, I loved Fear Factor it was probably my favorite show and I loved Rogan. I would record episodes on VHS and watch bug eating challenges going to sleep.


And then for the podcast, I listened pretty regularly into the early to mid 2010s. I sopped listening after getting bored of it. Never really got into his MMA commentating though.

However, I really have been noticing Joe Rogan getting A LOT of negative media attention which I think is unwarranted. Yes, he's not a medical expert you should trust, he's just a pot smoking fihter that you listen to in the background when trying to kill time on a long drive or doing chores, or taking a walk.


I don't believe the negative attention is warranted, and  Idon't understand the exorbitantly high standards the general population is putting on him just for having a large podcast.",22,0,0.47,millenials,7,Thursday,Evening

However, I find it difficult as many Millenials get triggered so easily. My first observation is that friendship bonding is based upon whatever ""trauma"" or issues that you experienced in your life. I'm not use to this. However, I also noticed that you get ""triggered"" easily.  For example, I made a friend who's roommate is non-binary and they go by ""them/they"" and I said that's the hardest pronoun grouping that I have troubled with and this seemed to have upset him as he's very close to his roommate. There are often times he's overwhelmed and only wants to text not talk on the phone. He's cancelled on many occasions because he's overwhelmed (new school, move/cat died). Also, they are highly political to date, for example, I had a date and he didn't want to date me anymore because I like Dave Chappelle.",20,0,0.29,millenials,13,Tuesday,Evening

15xfin2,2023-08-21 18:19:18,Four years into my career and I am a glorified personal assistant,"I have been in HR for the last 4 years. I have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. I’ve worked with small companies to large international corporations. I’ve done general HR and specialized in Talent Acquisition. I am a good worker. I always give 100% even when I only have 70% to give. I have countless recommendations on my LinkedIn account telling that story. 

And yet, I have been searching for a role in Talent Acquisition since last September unsuccessfully. Initially, I did get a few interviews and even made it to the final rounds of several. These days? I get a decline email if I am lucky. 

What my resume doesn’t tell you is that I have been a victim of circumstances. I am not a serial job hopper. I want to find my place in society, have stability. Since starting my career in HR, I have been forced to take contract after contract. Always with the dangling carrot of being brought on full-time. My first contract was extended once, with the promise that they would make me FT at the end of it. That didn’t happen, but you know what did? COVID. Bye-bye job security. Hello existential dread. 

I tried to keep myself busy and thankfully was able to launch an art business. While it did allow me to have some cashflow again, this was not my chosen career. Art is a hobby. I truly thrive when collaborating with a team, making a real impact to peoples lives. 

I finally caught a break at the start of 2021. I was hired once more for a short-term contract. I was put in an environment of sink or swim with little to no guidance. But I persevered and showed them my worth. I grew within the company, receiving two promotions within my eight-month tenure. Those who shine brightest will eventually burn out. And that it exactly what happened. I gave too much of myself to this role. I would work every weekend, always stay late and yet my compensation did not reflect that. I was earning 42K as a highly educated individual, with years of experience at this point. It wasn’t fair. I deserved better. So, I sought better.

Thinking I finally found it, my forever home, a place to grow professionally and flourish. Who cares if to get it I would have to do a long-term contract? Who needs health care. I will put my head down and do my best again; learn the company culture again; join a new team again. This was my 5th team in two years, having to prove myself yet again. And did I! I was thrown in yet again into the chaos, but this time I had support; this time I was able to do it with the help of an amazing colleague and manager. 

A new year began, and I was asked to join them full-time. My heart sang! Until I kept reading and realized they wanted me to take a 11K pay cut. I spent a month negotiating. I found out that they were planning to pay me the lowest salary in the allotted salary band for the role. I wondered; how can this make any sense? They’ve seen what I am capable of. They know that I am capable and have years of experience in the field. Why would they think I deserve the bare minimum? 

I said no. I was taken advantage of too many times in the past. I had been working in the professional space for over 7 years at this point having had a past in administration. I’ve paid my dues. I’ve done the grunt work; I’ve proved myself time and time again. I deserved more than the bare minimum. 

We ended the negotiation with the promise that my offer still stands and that we would revisit compensation in the mid-year review. Mid-year came along with many changes to the company structure. When I was brought on, the market was booming, and this company like many others, over hired. The easiest way to reduce over staffing is to let the contacts expire. 

I was offered a short-term contract extension to train my replacement, an amazing talent that was ready to be moved from a support position into an individual contributor. I am not proud of my decision. I know I should have stayed but there was an injustice in staying that I could not swallow. Why should I stay here and train my replacement when at the end of the year when Christmas comes around, I will be job less? This company is not looking out for my best interest, why should I look out for theirs? Not my finest moment, but it was a human moment. 

So, I spent the next eight months on the market. A Sahara dry desert of market. Many companies were dealing with the same thing, trying to balance out the over hiring. The market was flooded with incredible talent. No one was hiring for people to hire people when lay-offs are happening everywhere. 

Beaten by my experience, I lowered the bar and allowed myself to take a position that would not help my grow in my career. A position with an empty title and filled with indignities. I was an HR manager in name alone. Realistically, I was treated as glorified personal assistant. Normally, I wouldn’t have stuck around. But I got this job through a personal connection, and it was not just my reputation on the line. So, I have sucked it up and watched myself loose a myself piece by piece. I am no longer that eager go getter. And I am sad. 

I am sad for the woman I once was. I am sad that I have given so much of myself to all these companies and have only been left with a feeling of defeat. I prided myself on my accomplishments, stood up for myself after many injustices. Where did that leave me? Getting asked to search someone else’s email account for a phone number because they deem their time more valuable than mine. Getting asked to find a lease for their girlfriend’s vehicle because it doesn’t matter what I’ve accomplished in life before, this is where I am now. 

I have tried to remain positive. I’ve been applying and applying and on a good day, I receive a decline email. But mostly these applications and referrals end in me getting ghosted. This is the reality of a millennial who tried to launch their career as the pandemic hit. I get to get up each day, loose a bit more of myself, in order to make a “living” – a living where I can’t afford to move out of my parents’ home. I am barely surviving.

It was part of our identity and we formed friend groups based on what music and bands we listened to and go to the concerts together.

That's Zoomer fashion.

I went to a concert the other day and there was a Zoomer girl in 1990s mom jeans, 1980s glasses, some kind of 1920s-style blouse abomination, and some chunky 1950s pearls dancing  next to another Zoomer girl in a wife-beater and a blue fucking Smurf hat.

whenever we go out to a restaurant constantly 1 of my parents cares more about whoever messages them instead of talking to their child (me) even if we are in a middle of a convo apparently friends are more important.

if 1 of my parents is driving every single time they are trying to drive and look at their phone EVERY TIME and it pisses me off so much. 

my family no longer sits together as a family when it’s dinner time because there is no point because whenever we do my parents talk while on their phones or 1 of them is on their phones and i still follow the no phone rule when eating dinner on the table. 
my 2 brothers have moved out i graduated high school a couple of years ago now and still live with my parents as i am trying to figure life and my career im only in my early 20s anyways but my parents have just become lazy and addicted to their phones. 

i constantly have to yell at them to get their attention and even when im talking THEY ARE ALWAYS ON THEIR DAM PHONE and it annoys me soo much. my parents never were addicted to their phones and instead were constantly doing things or enjoying nature and that’s completely opposite now i have never seen any of them so addicted to their device.

yes i love them but this is what makes me so annoyed. does anyone else have this issue.

My opinion; I personally think there is change coming to this country regarding social media. Young people don’t use social media in the same way as older people.

1cd1ubg,2024-04-25 20:30:31,4th time moving across the country: my struggles as a young guy trying to navigate a broken economy,"Just wanted to rant a bit, because I'm feeling stressed out. I like to write when I'm stressed out. I thought my words might be able to relate to other young people coming of age in this era of high inflation and housing bubbles.

In January 2021, I moved from Cleveland to Albuquerque for an embedded internship while my school was remote/asynchronous due to the pandemic. I really loved New Mexico. This move was easy. I had a plane ticket, $2000 in my bank account, and a suitcase full of stuff. I wound up working my way up to a car. The job was great. I was only making $20/hr but I made many close friends and really discovered myself that year. I found my love of embedded, lifting weights, riding bikes, hiking, and the desert. I was happy. It was my first time being on my own and I felt like I crushed it.

At the end of the year, I had to move back to Cleveland to finish my schooling, which was a bit of a surprise to me. Two months after I got the news I packed up my car and made the 26 hour trek back to Cleveland. I wound up living in a condo my mom owned and finished up school. I had to pay rent, but she gave me a fair rate. I was not happy to need to survive another Cleveland winter, but hey, I graduated and was free. Or at least I thought I would be.

I applied all over the country, and by some strange twist of fate, I wound up getting a decent offer in New Mexico again in mid 2022. I had my whole life planned out. I was going to buy a house in the burbs with my salary and pay it off in a few years. I priced out the area and accepted the offer. Yet another 26 hour drive across the country with all my stuff in my car.

I made it about 6 months at the company until I realized that something was dreadfully wrong. This was during the 2022 housing spike, and the area I scoped out wound up skyrocketing 50% in price over the course of 6 months. I just wanted a tiny 2 bedroom house for 200k, which somehow shot up to 300k+. I was in disbelief.

Fortunately, I had a windfall. In January 2023 A buddy I worked with at my old job had a position open up for someone with my skillset, and they where in dire need of a firmware engineer. I applied, he sang my praises, and I wound up strong-arming the company into giving me a 60% pay bump. I was delighted, I thought I might actually be able to make it work out here after all. The only problem was that this company was a quasi-startup of sorts and had terrible, terrible management. I am proud of the work I did and my boss was very happy with me, but the money dried up. I wound losing my job 2 months ago.

Fortunately, I had seen this coming as I was not in the first wave of layoffs. I had my resume up on Indeed and wound up getting contacted by a recruiter at a big company working on a similar product to what I was working on out in the Chicago suburbs. I interviewed with them, and got an offer with a marginal paybump, maintaining my salary. On the same exact day the extended the offer, I got laid off at my job in ABQ. Once again, I had to move and had very little say in the matter.

I can't complain, I am very lucky to have had something lined up for me after losing my job. Most people don't get that luxury. The area I am moving to is nice, but man, even fixer-upper starter homes are pulling 300k there. I'm not too excited about the winters, either. I'm going to do my best to love it but I'm not sure this place is going to be where I settle down. I have a feeling I'll be moving again in 2 years once I have enough money saved up to buy a house somewhere more affordable.

I'm also a little nervous because I'm kicking around the idea of marrying my girlfriend and I don't know how much she'll wind up making. She has an engineering degree but its from a Mexican University and we'll have some immigration stuff to deal with. I'm making good money, but even with that, how will I be able to provide for her while I try to pay off a house? I'm pulling 160k but what does that even mean if my standard of living is going to be, at best, living in a run down 1000sqft fart box?

I don't want to sound like I'm complaining because I have a lot of good stuff going for me, but man is it tough to make it in this economy. I'm getting very tired of moving and it really feels like every area I move to just wants to make as much money as possible off me and spit in my face. ""Want to live here? How about you take on half a million in debt for my old shit shack and pay $15k yearly in property taxes?"" The idea of kids are off the table completely for at least the next 8 years and I'm 26 now. I've done nothing but save money since I started working and it just feels like the more I save the more expensive houses get. Like, I'm not a bum. I sacrificed. I saved. I worked hard. I developed my skills. Why is it that the only things that are available to me are scraps?

I'm packing up my stuff right now to move again. Feels like I'm saying goodbye to an old friend leaving New Mexico. I didn't want to move but I felt like I have no choice. Sorry for the essay, I just felt a need to verbalize my struggles.",1,1,0.67,GenZ,18,Thursday,Evening
1cd1mty,2024-04-25 20:22:55,Gen Zs wouldn't share weed,"
TLDR: young folks at public event wouldn't share doobie with old guy. Is this normal/common?


Had an interaction with some Gen Zers that makes me (59m) curious. We were at a professional sporting event in Calif, 100s of folks on a grassy area pregaming with food and alcohol. A couple feet away from my wife and I a group of four or five young adults, prob 18-22 yo, were passing a large joint around in their circle. The smoke was blowing right in my face and I thought it smelled pretty good so I stepped into their circle and said something like ""mind if I take a hit off that?""

I was denied. A male looked at me quizically with a half smile and said ""you're a stranger.""  I backed off immediately and said ""no problem guys, I don't wanna make any of you uncomfortable."" A girl then said (trying  nicely to explain), ""we just don't wanna get sick."" I said ""It's fine, don't worry about it."" And that was it. 

I've been smoking pot since early 80s and grew up with a ""share-the-wealth"" attitude; as long as there was enough weed, hell yeah, let's ALL get high. Maybe years ago weed was more illicit and we had a sense of ""partners in crime"" and ""stoners unite!"" If an older guy wanted to get high with us we'd LOVE it -- dude, we got high with an old geezer, so cool!

My questions:
1) is it common for younger folks to NOT share weed (or anything?) with strangers?
2) is it a post-Covid thing (of course we didnt have this years ago and I totally understand if this is the reason)?
3) is it the anti-Boomer thing that I read so much of on Reddit?
4) Is it because weed is so prevalent that folks think ""get your own""?

I’m a SAHM and dress pretty casually, so I was wondering if anyone could answer these questions about the details for styling a casual outfit:

1) I get that skinny jeans are out and wide legs are in. A lot of my jeans are mom jeans or straight leg cropped. Are these out? Is it all about full length jeans now?

2) On a related note, what’s this about no show socks being out? If I’m wearing jeans and sneakers, should I wear a taller sock so no ankle shows? Or does it look weird to have a lot of visible sock if the jeans are cropped?

3) I’ve heard the French tuck is out. Do you do either cropped or fully tucked? I have some Madewell tees that are too short to be tucked and too long to be cropped. What do you do with those?

1ccrnkt,2024-04-25 13:14:46,I don’t really buy the whole going out is too expensive ,"As the title says I don’t think that saying it’s too expensive to go out is that valid of an argument, I think people just use that as an excuse to not socialise. I think that argument is valid for people living in rural places with fuck all to do but wasn’t that always the case? My dad grew up in a rural place and told me back in those days the only things young people did for fun was burn cars, fuck and do drugs, cause there was literally no where to go and the only way to do something was to move out of those places, and this is Australia so no Walmart, not even a target. Where he grew up was literally nothing but like once local tavern and a shooting range. 

In city and urban areas there is always something free to do. Bars are expensive yes but you don’t have to drink or you can drink beforehand. Like grab a few friends pitch in like $5 - 10 each and buy a bottle of vodka and takes swigs from it before going out, saves so much money and is exactly what my parents did. Or steal booze from your parents, again what my parents did when they were young. 

I was looking online and found posts of free music gigs in my city and there were literally so many. Like just free gigs to see like 4 different bands each night, it was insane, every day of the week there was tons of stuff. And I live in a relatively small city. Why don’t people do that? It’s good as well cause u socialise, find and support local music, have fun and maybe get laid. U might even find people to start a band with, it’s a common way of doing that. Art galleries are free, a lot of festivals are free, just going down shopping strips which still exist where I live, house parties, people’s houses, interest clubs, social meetups, parks, sight seeing nature, fishing, volunteering, just walking around or hanging out, skate parks, beaches, I’m sure ur families do things u can invite friends along too, camping is relatively cheap, cinemas aren’t too expensive, plus u don’t go to them very often, $20 every month or so to see a movie with friends isn’t that bad and so so much more stuff. Like so many free or inexpensive things to do. When people say stuff is expensive what stuff do they actually mean?? Like buying drink at nightclubs?? Definitely that costs waaauyy too much but they’re always ways around these things, be creative and find solutions. If u guys really wanted to have fun, you’d find a way. Like don’t buy drinks at a night club, drink before hand or pop a few pills before going in it’s literally a free night. I’m not a fan of nightclubs but if u like them I’m sure there are ways around the expenses. 

I guess going out for dinner is pricey yes, but hasn’t it always been kinda pricey if u do it often? Also if that’s all ur doing it’s a bit boring. It’s just one thing right?. Idk about conventions but again they don’t happen very often, it’s not a weekly expense. I also look around my college campus and at bars and see posters and ads for stuff like interest meetups or political protests, or meetings, clubs or art stuff, like why not go to that with friends? It’s all free. 

A lot of gen z still live with their parents, especially in cities, what r u spending ur money on if it is not rent?? I get if ur paying rent and working a shit ton its hard but sparing a few hours a week to hangout with friends isn’t that unreasonable?? Like going out every Saturday night for a few hours isn’t that insane of a time sink. I work 2 minimum wage jobs, I work like 25 - 30+ a week and study and still manage to find the time to party and do stuff even with my social anxiety. Maybe if ur studying medicine it’s hard but most people aren’t doing that. Idk if people just use the cost of going out as an excuse to not socialise but it feels like it. 

What r ur thoughts. I just noticed this when looking for gigs and realised most of the gigs in my city were free!!! And that’s just rock, indie and metal shows there are probably tons more for rap cause it’s more popular ",13,0,0.42,GenZ,11,Thursday,Afternoon

In this ever-evolving world, Gen Z stands on the verge of a mega technological leap, where AI has much to contribute. They are smart to focus on more productive tasks by assigning their redundant assignments to Chat GPT, but they also fear job losses, which are inevitable as we move into the future. AI is becoming more intelligent with each passing day, as evidenced by the entry of Devin AI, although it is still not capable of replacing engineers. However, it is capable enough to replace entry-level work. Let’s consider the comments from the official video released by Cognition Labs to introduce Devin. Students were so frustrated. Some suggested that it should be called Devil instead of Devin. Others expressed heartbreak, mentioning that they were attending a boot camp to learn coding and build a career, only to be disheartened by Devin’s capabilities. Some even went as far as to say that software engineers are digging their own graves by building such models. All this shows that Gen Z is just worried about their future prospects and how they will achieve success in such a competitive environment, which is further magnified by these AI technologies.

1cb7oye,2024-04-23 15:37:36,"Gen Z isn’t lazy, but college did a terrible job of preparing us for what life actually is and what it requires. ","I see a lot of posts about leaving college and rent and debt and how hard it is to get a job and do taxes and shit (even though it’s like the easiest it’s ever been in our society to do those things, but hey I was never taught how to do that shit either)

But I’m also genuinly starting to be convinced a lot of young people these days went to college purely because they wanted to stay students and kids for longer, drink and party and have fun in their early adult years and when they realize they actually have to pay for it or they actually have to get a job with their degree and work. 

Like bro, if you didn’t wanna go into debt, why did you go to a college that costed you 100,000 a year? Well I think I know why. It’s because smaller colleges don’t have as much fun. It’s expensive to go to UPenn or UMD or USC or Arizona state, or any large university. There are more people there, more bars, more opportunities to have fun and get a part time easy job or get an internship because they’re located in or near big cities, and they’re also MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. But I don’t think people really go to college for education anymore they go because it’s a social experience. You get to spend your young adult years still getting spring breaks, summer breaks, holiday breaks.

And then the reality sets in when they graduate and they’re $40k in debt (for loans that they willingly took out) and they realize living actually requires effort.

But also, colleges feel designed like that now. I’ve even heard people say “college isn’t about the education really, it’s about the social experience.” And then I realized that may be the biggest problem with our generation. We aren’t fucking lazy, we just were never properly prepared for reality.

I’ve also seen this attitude (though much less frequently) from younger parents. I always get pissed when younger parents are like, shocked or pissed that they can’t go out on weekends because they have a baby. Or they “have no social life” Like they didn’t expect being a parent to be a full time thing.

Like, no. I hate to be this fucking guy, but, your carefree life is genuinly over. Now is the time where you actually have to put in effort to live. It has been that way in every society since the dawn of humanity, that at a certain point, there is no more play whenever you want. 

I hate the “adulting sucks” meme and shit people say about it because yeah, no shit, it’s been that way for thousands of years and it will be that way for thousands more. Being an adult fucking sucks, actually working fucking sucks, no matter what you do it’s still work. Having obligations sucks. 

Leaving college and getting a job and a house was honestly a kick in the nuts for me. I had friends that were still in college that wanna go out all the time, play video games late, drink on weekdays. That may be the life for a select few, but I feel like people don’t want their easy college schedules and lives to end. They think that when they get a job in whatever field they studied, it’s gonna be the same.

And ultimately when they’re hit with a reality they didn’t expect, I think we get so many rant posts about how hard it is to balance life, spending time with friends and working when you have bills and rent and people to take care of. Now you have to buy your own food, your own clothes, clean your own house.

Some have more experience with this than others, but I think people in our generation are convinced that the college experience prepares them more for life than it actually does. Because it really doesn’t, not even close.

After being graduated for about 2 years now, I can tell you, college was so fucking easy and I don’t think my life was ever easier. And I think a lot of older Gen Z are coming to this realization and it’s hitting a lot of younger Gen Z right now.


TL;DR Gen Z isn’t lazy, people just think we are because we bitch about shit that we should’ve expected (but weren’t prepared for because college doesn’t actually teach us how to be adults.) I don’t blame Gen Z, I just think we should’ve been prepared better.


Edit:

I think people are confused and I didn’t make myself clearer: this isn’t my experience. This is my response to all the “why is adulting so hard” mfs who post in this chat and are coping about how they can’t find a job.
I found a job, I am big chilling, this was about mfs in our generation who didn’t grow the fuck up and realize college should be where you go to learn how to work in a career and not a place where you can pretend to be a child. But that’s what it’s become for a lot of people.


I was saying it as a bad thing that a sizeable portion of people go to college basically to ride the whole school thing for 4 years as an adult to avoid the reality of being an adult and when they complain about it in this sub it’s cringe and annoying. 

Mf you took the loans out, you got a shitty degree, you went to college because you wanted to have fun and now you’re shocked that you never learned how to budget your money or write a resume. 

TL;DR: I’m tired of this sub being about people complaining about debt and rent and capitalism and how fucking hard everything is. Grow up. Life is hard, college was easy, you’re privileged to even have been able to go. Stop complaining about your existence, join the fucking army or something, and stop asking for 3 day work weeks where you get to work from home because you’re used to getting coddled by your huge university.

1cbw6k5,2024-04-24 11:51:38,Brainrot is real,"
This post is extremely long so bear with me,
 
It never occurred to me that so many people rely on their phones to live until recently, around the end of 2021 I uninstalled social media and pretty much have used nothing except YT and Reddit which I would use every now and then, but now that I’ve picked up the habit of leaving my phone and airpods at home I constantly observe what other people do and my God all those boomers who said that kids can’t live without their phones weren’t lying, I understand needing it for actual emergencies but so many kids (at least in my city) always lose their shit whenever a teacher confiscates their phone or tells them to put it away, I also realized that phone usage makes people very incompetent of doing any serious tasks for a long period of time, any time I go to the library with other students to study so many of them take breaks like every 15 minutes and make more time to scroll on TikTok or Instagram for 30 minutes or more, it’s almost like they cannot focus with opening social media; the worst part is that what we do is reflected onto the younger generation, any time I look at middle schoolers so many of them speak and act like they’re either social media influencers or they can’t converse about anything that isn’t related to social media. 
The other issue is that on social media we have a variety of influencers:

A) The super popular ones like Charli damelio, because of mass media usage I overhear so many people wanting to do “Content Creation” as a side hustle or as their actual career…

B) Skincare / Beauty influencers

This ones has hit its peak 2023 and now the amount of people who post daily about their skincare routine and just blindly lead their followers into a trap of consumerism is insane not to mention the looksmaxxing people which I’ve come across even here on reddit, which is making people think that the only way you can be deemed as even slightly attractive is if you look like an A list super model.

C) The “Body positivity” Influencers, 

being in America already there is a large amount of obese citizens but as I age I see that there is more & more of them and so many are becoming social media activists and are quite literally promoting obesity to their younger audiences and pulling the “All bodies are healthy” bs. 
red flag right there.

D) Red pill Alpha male incels

Probably one of the worst ones right now on Youtube I’ve come across so many shorts of either fresh & fit or Andrew tate spewing the most obscene pieces of advice to their young male audience, saying things like 
“Your wife should stay with you if you cheat”
“If she doesn’t cook a 5 course meal for you every day then she’s not the one” 
and so many more unrealistic standards for women I wont lie, I see many young women feeling entitled as well, with the sprinkle sprinkle stuff and all of them wanting to marry millionaires and fighting for pretty privilege and such, but what the men give as advice is quite literally just tutorials on how to emotionally and verbally abuse their spouses. 

E) Aesthetic influencers

Since quarantine up until 2024 the idea of fitting into certain aesthetics has grown but 2021 till today is when it genuinely started to grow at a rampant rate, any time I talk about fashion with other people of Gen Z the first question they always ask is “What aesthetic is that?” Which it isn’t offensive but the idea of only fitting into one category in terms of lifestyle and how you dress is incredibly stupid imo.

Another thing about excessive media consumption is the way everything has to be watered down or have a trigger warning like omfg, the other day one of my friends got kicked out of her other friend group because she said that spanish music wasn’t really her taste and they all found it “iCRedIBlY oFfeNSiVe” like bro 😭 you’ll be fine if someone doesn’t agree with you for once. Anyways this just a rant due to everything but in all seriousness I feel like most of Gen Z should just detox from social media for like a month to geta grasp on reality.",17,15,0.7,GenZ,3,Wednesday,Morning

1. Learning/assistance moving out.

Most college require living in a dorm. People underestimate how important this is. It teach you how to live with other people, and depending on the context it can be used as renting experience. For people who have never left their parent house, having a safe structured place to move out to is huge. 

2. Learning how to self manage time. 

Some might have had this experience in highschool, but the reality is college may be the first time you actively are responsible for showing up to places. Not only that but learning how to focus on boring task like studying for hours at a time is a major skill help in all kinda of work.

3. Learning how to navigate buecracy.

School have websites, admission, it help desk, and the much more, just like the real world. You get to learn how to interact and work with in these system.

4. How to email people.

In other words basic professional communication. You've written papers, and you've emailed professors. Don't underestimate this, because God damn is it obvious when someone doesn't know how to send an email.

5. Job fair, and job advice.

The biggest problem irl is that people don't know what jobs are out there, and ""googling it"" will never be enough if you don't know what to google. Job fair and talking to your professor allows you to broaden the scope of what is out there and find a career for you. Bonus point for internship that really happen from college, giving you literal job experience.

6. Friend and connections.

College is a place where you can meet some of the greatest people who can affect your life in amazing ways. Not only with just friendship, but in career ways as well. You'd be suprised how often people find jobs through friends.

7. Managing your own money.

College will be the first time people have to actively manage their own money. If you think every college student is just collecting debt living the highlife your delusional. There is a reason they joke about college kids eating Ramen 3 meals a day. 


8. A fucking degree.

Literal proof that you have learned all the above. The amount of job that just want a 4 year degree and don't care which is higher then you think, and it's not because their stupid, it because they know for a fact if you have the paper you can atleast show up to class and turn work in on time, 

If you don't get anything out of college, I'm sorry to say maybe that your fault. College is overpriced and Student debt can be crippling, but thats not because college offers nothing. You have the option to take advantage of the network college provides, to get the most out of the experience.

TLDR: college provides a stepping stone from highschool and the real world, one where you get skills, and a safe place to explore what you want to do the rest of your life

I can't go to college because i'm poor af, but if somebody was to ask me, i would have to go with nursing. Mostly because of my background. During high school i wanted to be a combat medic, but then surgery happened on both Achilles tendons to loosen them, it didn't go to well, and wouldn't be able to qualify. And i will be honest and say that i am honestly quite fascinated with medical stuff. because besides me wanting to be a combat medic, i looked into therapies, phlebotomy, etc.  Even now and today. The only thing that can keep my attention besides art and music is hospice stuff.

So yeah would have to go with nursing",208,89,0.94,GenZ,13,Tuesday,Night
1cc5lnu,2024-04-24 18:24:23,i feel like politicians dont want trifectas for their own side,"think about it.....when you have a trifecta...there is ZERO excuse to not get all your stuff done. All eyes are on you to do what you said.

Now if politicians WANTED change, this would be positive, but they dont want change that serves the people over the corporations

Lets look at some good case studies.

We will take 4 states with veto proof majorities: California, New York, Texas, Florida

in all 4 states, the minority party has ZERO representation in government, and thus the majority has free reign. We should come up with a fix for that, but thats a different discussion.

Lets start with the republicans and their platform pulled from their website:

""Republicans believe in liberty, economic prosperity, preserving American values and traditions, and restoring the American dream for every citizen of this great nation. As a party, we support policies that seek to achieve those goals. Our platform is centered on stimulating economic growth for all Americans, protecting constitutionally-guaranteed freedoms, ensuring the integrity of our elections, and maintaining our national security.""

\*looks at texas and florida

.......bullshit

now for Democrats

""Democrats believe that the economy should work for everyone, health care is a right, our diversity is our strength, and democracy is worth defending. Democrats across the country are working hard to build a better America. We’re fighting to build an economy that works for everyone by lowering costs for working families and investing in the middle class. Democrats are dedicated to ensuring a stronger and more just future for every American.""

\*looks at new york and california

........bullshit

when faced with ZERO opposition, neither dems or repubs will do what they say. 

\*looks at approval rating for politicians in these state.....bingo! 

The problem with trifectas is that when you innevitably fail to pass the bullshit you tweet about, there isnt a scapegoat. You cant point a finger to the other side being obstructionist.

Biden had a trifecta. Remember when legalizing weed would have been the easiest thing ever and a total layup on republicans.....but he couldnt do it with a trifecta? Cant point to republicans because they arent in power......AH lets blame manchin, he is a good scapegoat. if not manchin then sinema, or the filibuster.......lots of excuses

remember when trump was going to build the wall? What happened? you had a trifecta! just sweep it under the board, or blame McConnell for not playing ball. more excuses

Neither party wants a trifecta. They know they wont do what they promise, and leveraging the minority party as an obstructionist scapegoat is too convenient for them.",14,5,0.72,GenZ,11,Wednesday,Evening

These kids are living and learning, there’s going to be moments where they fuck up and ruin people’s day, children should not be considered a burden and I think that’s why we tend to look down on the younger generations. I understand most parents are disengaged in their children’s lives so these kids don’t get taught to act better. That’s why we have to be an example so they know how to be well adjusted adults.

I thought I wanted to be a middle school ELA teacher to help make middle school just a little bit easier for those in it. 

I’m currently doing my middle school teacher placement, and I make really good lesson plans, but then it all falls apart when I actually teach the lesson. 

Engage. Engage. Engage. Don’t lecture. Don’t explain. Let them take control. Is all I’ve heard for the past four years and in this program. 

Today I had my second observation and it was horrible. I tried to make the lesson engaging by using sketching as a tool to access the main idea of the story. I did a practice lesson yesterday that went fine. But today it fell apart. I wanted to model more examples for the kids, because yesterday I felt like I needed to do more. Well, that was a mistake. They were zoned out and not understanding the main idea. 

Every lesson I plan seems to not go as planned during the actual lesson. 

I’ve thought about library science, marketing, publishing and or politics as careers if this doesn’t work out. Because I love middle school students and remember what it was like ten years ago for me. But at times I feel like this is not the right path for me to take. But then the other side of me is saying, stick with it. You’re already gonna get your masters program in it. Ugh. Why is life so hard to figure out? ",6,1,0.67,GenZ,7,Wednesday,Evening

1cc62gc,2024-04-24 18:42:52,Anyone else feel like they haven’t changed much?,"I went through some personal growth between around late 6th grade until somewhere between sophomore and junior year of high school. 

During that time, I formed new opinions on things, found new hobbies/interests, dropped some things, and overall just became my own individual for the most part. 

Since then, I have barely changed as a person and I’m 21 now. I look back at myself at 17 and don’t think I was much different then than I am now. I hear that during college is where you find yourself, and that you look back on the you from 1-2+ years ago and laugh at yourself. Obviously I’ve matured and learned more since then, but I don’t think the core me is any different. 

I still listen to the same music in the same genres. I still play the same exact games (at least the same types of games). I have the same sense of humor, like the same kind of content on YouTube and TV, have the same hobbies, have the same academic interests, like the same type of people, and even like the same kinds of food. I have the same moral and ethical stances I did then, and my political views have largely stayed the same, I just know more nuance about stuff now. I even spend money on the same type of stuff. 

Overall, the only change that I think I’ve made since being like 17 is that I’m not a bit more extroverted (forcefully made myself that way after covid ended and when entering college) and I’m now into fantasy football. That’s it besides getting bigger and maturing basically. Anyone else feel the same? Idk if the lockdown caused this, if I just went through the finding myself stage early, if I have still yet to go through it, or if it’s something else entirely.

Although it wasn't planned, we're in a stable financial and career position, so we embraced the news wholeheartedly. Sometimes, I wonder if we're too young to be starting a family, but older generations like Boomers and Gen X reassure us that it was quite normal to have kids at our age in their time.

However, when we share our news with other Gen Zers, reactions vary. Some are surprised we're excited about parenthood, much like when they were taken aback by our engagement at 21. Yet, we also encounter Millennials and Gen Z peers who are parents themselves, some who started even younger than us. Their experiences are a spectrum—some thoroughly enjoy parenthood, while others find it miserable.

The environmental protection group's cubs are clamoring for environmental protection to be handed over to the descendants of the global environment, but do you care about the future environment?




Even if I were to protect the environment, those cubs that would exist in the future wouldn't thank me anyway, and it doesn't matter to me who will live in this land for less than 100 years, but it's just my hard work? That's a lot of nonsense




Worries about low birth rates, environmental concerns, and so on are all brainwashed. Who do you want to like?




There should be no intention of practicing environmental protection, but rather living with the intention of destroying the environment as much as possible.




You can spit out phlegm on the street, pee, throw cigarette butts, spit out gum, use a lot of disposable containers, throw trash anywhere, and don't separate them at home, and hit them all in a standard garbage bag.




You should never use eco-friendly products such as detergents and soap.




It is reasonable to live with a mind to practice environmental destruction within the range of daily life.




Since humans exist anyway, the environment is bound to be destroyed, and humans themselves, who are selfish and hypocritical than anyone else, are cancer cells.




Factory operations, industrial facilities, wastewater from those places are much more environmentally polluted, and if you ignore that and encourage individual environmental campaigns, it's just brainwashing



What's wrong with destroying the environment when it doesn't have a big impact on individuals doing more or less environmental protection? There is no need to overdo it.




Rather, it is more beneficial to live with the mindset of contributing 0.001% to environmental destruction than environmental protection.




It becomes difficult to live together, so if mankind is destroyed, there will be no need to worry about the environment.




Therefore, the environment must be destroyed and all humans must disappear from the earth.




Humans are the most harmful beings on Earth, and it is contradictory for humans to claim environmental protection.

1cbrtme,2024-04-24 06:58:10,incrementalism and accelerationism are the 2 dumbest ideologies ive heard of,"ive recently come across 2 political ideologies i havent heard of before.....and man....theyre bad

before, let me just say that the way these ideologies work on paper is different than the actual things people advocate for with these, so ill just be criticizing the reality of these ideologies rather than what they are on paper. Also this is from the perspective of someone in the US

1) incrementalism

ok so this one.....i just dont get. incrementalism is essentially accepting the status quo and insisting on working within it. incrementalists despise the idea of doing anything outside the status quo system in order to change it, the only change can come from within and it must be small. So like.....Lincoln, FDR, LBJ, Reagan, WASHINGTON.....incrementalists would have hated them.

the problem with incrementalism is that it conditions you to accept breadcrumbs when you deserve more and more importantly could have gotten more. 

""I saw 2 $100 bills on the ground, and i picked 1 up! what a lucky day!""

Another glaring problem....is not so much with incrementalism itself, but rather the people who advocate for it. I notice they miss the forest for the trees alot.

Like imagine you totaled your car, an incrementalist would say its more important to repaint it than to put the front bumper back on. Its weird....they take pleasure in and prioritize fixing small problems before big ones. Ever hear someone cop out and say ""well we cant accomplish X big problem until Y unrelated menial problem is fixed"". Like they have to find excuses to give up on stuff.

ill never forget my debate with an incrementalist, where I essentially told them: ""your solution to slavery and the holocaust is just to wait until all the racist people die of old age, you wouldnt allow revolutionary action"". They were left speechless and tried to backtrack saying how its different from modern working class oppression.

Last thing ill say about incrementalism is that it leaves too much room for the erasure of progress. Example. Lets say you take 1 step forward, and then 4 years later you take 1 step back, rinse and repeat. Have you really made progress? How about we strive for stuff that the elites cant strip away in 4 years, or we can keep regardless of the outcome of an election? 

Incrementalists will never trade comfort for progress, but they will tweet and virtue signal about it

2) accelerationism

kind of the opposite problem really.

to be as fair as i can....I get why accelerationism looks good on paper. youre ripping off a bandaid. accelerationism basically states ""things are getting worse, they will only ever get worse, lets just speed it up to minimize casualties and oppression"". Admittedly its a good theory.

Look at the inevitable failing of the status quo, and let it come to its logical conclusion faster. ""Fast to fail, fast to rebuild"" as I was taught in my engineering classes.

Interestingly, accelerationism is something i see libertarians and communists both come together on....how wholesome. 

Accelerationism has two main problems

firstly, accelerationism doesnt prioritize the working class. Its just a free for all, strongest will emerge from the ashes. this is not necessarily  the best approach for working class liberation when it doesnt involve class collaboration

secondly, and this is probably the biggest problem, accelerationism is redundant. I dont really understand why its more desirable than just normal revolutionary action. Like sure, accelerating the decay of the current system is fine, but just seizing it externally and starting over seems faster. Like it just seems counterintuitive.

The GOAL of accelerationism is better than incrementalism, its just less thought out.",11,2,0.62,GenZ,11,Wednesday,Morning

1cabugm,2024-04-22 14:13:05,Kids shouldn't have phones.,"Coming from a 16 year old guy...
I've heard people say that you shouldn't give your kid a phone until you're ready for their childhood to end. I didnt realize the extent to which kids are effected by them. Attention spans are diminishing by the day, innocence is lost, and kids aren't playing with each other anymore. Crucial aspects of childhood are lost due to lazy parenting and unmonitored screen time (and societal car dependancy but thats a story for a different day). Kids are also starting social media way too early. I've seen 7 year olds on tiktok, YouTube shorts, and even instagram. If you've seen the state if instagram lately, you'd see that its no place for a child. There's so much unhealthy activity on that app lately. Comment sections are filled with racism, misogyny, homophobia, the whole deal. Ignoring whatever personal views you have on these topics, kids internalize things more than others. Being surrounded by this much hatred, regardless if its a joke, isnt good for anyone, let alone young minds. Those young girls that are obsessed with skin care and anti aging products have been fooled by consumerism presented to them through their phones. The lululemon and stanley cup girls as well. The issue of kids being overexposed to the internet is a bigger problem than it appears. It could be addressed in multiple ways. Tightening minimum age standards on social media apps (or actually enforcing them) is an obvious option, but phone manufacturers should offer a more kid friendly phone, aimed more at communication with family, or real friends, rather than strangers. Parents also need to stop giving their kid a screen just to get them to shut up. Many parents use their need to communicate with their kids as the reason they've given their kid a phone, but many simply have unrestricted internet access, which is very dangerous at a young age. You could argue that restricting internet access to children is censorship, however, if children need the internet for information,  they can pay a visit to their local library, ask a parent for help, or inquire of a teacher.

In my high school, I remember these 5 guys playing with an office chair that just sat outside, and they would ride it down a slope to the track. Of course, there was no need for someone to push as unlike with a trolley, their feet could touch the ground when sitting.

Technically he is at the very cusp of Gen Z as he was born in 1996 if I’m not mistaken.

He also has said he is the appointed head of the badly aged Gen Z unit.

When I first watched Jordan, I honestly thought he was a 42 year old father of 3. 

He looks like a guy in his early 40s and gives off tired dad vibes. 

When he said he was 27, I was like WHAT? I am 33 and he looks older than I am.

1cbizhp,2024-04-23 23:09:57,Help me tackle my growing Doomerism,"As the title says, I used to be a really politically active and enthusiastic Teenager. Worked for the Bernie Sanders Campaign, Helped in Local Election, Attended Protests and Marches, Debated constantly against ideologies and people whose mind would be seeped in Conservatism, Sexism, Etc. 

Now however, the older I grow and the more information I read in regards to Climate Change, Political Lobbying, Gerrymandering, Proxy Wars occurring around the world, the rise of conservatism and far right ideologies around the world (Among us Gen Z folks as well), the inability to convince people to even listen to my ideas about challenging the systems of Capitalism (I cant even get through my friends and family anymore) & simply participating in society and seeing my lack of ability to do any meaningful change, I am becoming less & less caring about the world or even my fellow humans.

For example recently XQC & ADIN ROSS had a debate on Trans people and the comments section was ridiculous. So many of those people who are spitting hateful and harmful language towards the Queer Community are Gen Z and Gen Alpha. The growing Rise of Red-Pill & Far Right Conservative spaces with even some of the people I know in my personal life turning to conservatism and hate towards Immigrants (Which I am), woman (My sister has seen this in her own life in the dating market wherein she gets hated on by men for stating she does not want to have children), the response from so many Hindu family members of mine towards the support of Isreal and the general destruction of my Muslim brothers and sisters, the demonization of Science in real life conversations I have had with people I meet in public libraries (It being fake and Liberal), Educated Family members saying Climate Change is part of life and they wont stop to think of the world since they are on their way out. 

I feel so exhausted even with even Liberals and Far Left folks who now no longer understand that people can make mistakes and that conservatives and others arent bad people who we should give up on. So many people I talk to these days in public settings swear by the idea of cutting off everyone who does not align with leftist politics. So many of them find enjoyment In moral superiority and the idea that they have never done a bad thing in their life, often forgetting to give empathy and understanding to why some people may have taken those steps in their life. Some of them don't even give a chance to people who have changed their minds, pointing to their past as indicative behavior of who they truly are. However at the same time I feel like perhaps they are right, I should give up on convincing anyone on the right or middle because I feel like my words are simply falling on Deaf Ears.   
  
Moreovere, so many leftist and Liberals ignore that minority communities (Which I am a part of, Queer/Brown) have such terrible individualism. So many times I feel betrayed by fellow Asian, Black, Queer, etc who see harmful content or Unfunny Jokes and say, ""I am not offended, you are just being melodramatic."" There is no community cohesion anymore even among liberals and leftists and minority communities. 

Finally, the nail in the coffin for me these days is simply the lack of empathy or sympathy. So many people these days saying if you don't like the system, you are just a loser who is not motivated to Mental Health isn't real to Man UP to ICKS to I turned out fine and people no longer want to take responsibility to citing religion and person convictions as fundamental rules of life (Devoid of Secularism or Different Way of thinking) to MY PAIN MADE ME GROW, I WILL DO THE EXACT SAME THING MY PARENTS & COMMUNITY DID TO ME TO REST (refusing to understand different people react differently to Pain, Betrayal, lack of emotional support, abuse, etc)   
  
This and even more experiences has been getting to me and I slowly think we are simply doomed. I feel like even if we achieve some sort of change or revolution, the world we will inherit will be too far gone and broken.   
Someone said on some reddit post, ""Your hope is misguided and unfounded. Just because you find emotional comfort in delusion, doesn’t mean I’m going to enable it,"" in response to people calling them out for being a Doomer and I cant help but agree. I do not want to be like this though because I understand this what Older Generation/Younger Generation Conservatives want from us. To Give up. So if people could help me out, post some articles about things being on the up on up or even relate, please do tell.

1cb83se,2024-04-23 15:54:00,Dating apps and social media have killed our humanity,"I think that dating apps ruining dating. But even beyond that, social media has had the same effect on our entire lives but more subtly. Why?

**Dating Apps Give The Illusion of Infinite Choice**

If someone doesn't like one little quirk about you, they can decide to end it or ghost you. In their mind, the ""plenty of fish in the sea"" mentality is real. However, we have taken this too far in dating apps. People are looking for someone who is exactly like them, or someone they have too many values aligned which doesn't push them to rethink their values. Having someone who thinks differently than you can be a great thing. Especially when you're going through a tough time and need a different perspective on something.

**The Effects of Social Media**

I think social media has had a similar effect. We have people who have thousands of friends and followers on social media apps but still say they feel lonely. The same way that people throw people away on dating apps, they throw friends away IRL because they think they will always be able to have a connection with someone.

However, real friendships can take a while to build as you need to spend a certain amount of time with someone in reality to build real trust. You cannot make REAL friend online. Sure, there might be people you meet and can talk to but that deeper level of friendship can only be found in real life.

I have a friend that I only know through social media and I do consider him a good friend of mine. But would I go out of my way to do something for him? Probably not. He wouldn't expect the same as me either. If we did grow our friendship in real life and made time for each other, I think the friendship would blossom more but that's a challenge considering we live in different states.

**Conclusion**

Trust can take a while to build with someone. Some things can accelerate that trust but generally, you will never find that online. Social media and dating apps are designed to be addicting because we think we are going to win something that we are missing, which is companionship.

The only way to find companionship and friendship is to do it in real life. Online friends and dating is the equivalent of junk food for the soul. Sure it may nourish it enough to keep it alive but over a certain amount of time, it will become malnourished.

But we’ve been conditioned for years by social media apps to a cheap dopamine addiction that can only be fulfilled with more scrolling. We want to get off of our devices, but it can be really hard because they are so ingrained in our lives. Not only does this hurt us individually, but it hurts our society and culture. I think it’s really important to take measures to reduce your screen time as much as possible. Personally, I use a screen time tracking / motivation app called BePresent, never let my phone enter the bedroom, silence all notifications, and leave my phone in grayscale mode. Doing these things ensures that I’m using my phone only as the tool it was meant to be, instead of getting sucked into a toxic social media doomscroll hole.",6,0,0.45,GenZ,9,Tuesday,Afternoon

If so, have you found a cause for it? A solution?

Personally, I’ve found that sleeping for too long, taking naps even, absolutely wrecks me. Can’t function for the entire day after that.

I forced myself to stay awake early in the morning, after waking up (fragmented sleep), and so far I could say that today has been a good day.

Still don’t have all the answers I want, for the debilitating brain fog I sometimes experience, but I digress.

If you’re struggling with that fog, just know that you aren’t alone. And, I wish you the best of luck in healing from it.

1cb6ue2,2024-04-23 15:01:50,"Enshittification doesn't apply to just the internet, but everything really ","This was originally meant to be a rant on the declining quality of services, mostly those online, AKA enshittification, but it applies to everything. 

All social media apps have a shitton³ of bugs. YouTube is toxic to its creators and its community. Twitter is dying and promoting right wing bigots. All the internet is littered with ads. Google is now an advertising pole where you make it to the top if you pay for it. 

But it's not just online services. Everything else is shitty and colorless, devoid of life, sucks our your soul and corporate.  

Look at what is outside our houses. 100 years ago, there were ornamented townhouses in different colors. Cars were colorful. Heck, even in the 80s they were colored with even roofs being a different color from the car's main body. Now? It's just bland white, grey, and black landscape. Can you name car colors other than just black, grey, white, red and blue? No! Now buildings are just dirty, white, grey and black with rows of undecorated mass produced apartament blocks, dirty and neglected public service buildings and transit stations and stops, sprawling malls and parking lots, as well as ads and billboards everywhere. 

Ads thrash every place they occupy. I really don't want every thought, view and so on to be interrupted by an information I need to buy stuff. You can see near the border between Poland and Germany when the border is because looking from the German side you see where the billboards on the Polish side start.      

Everywhere else is the same. Even if you live in an area with trees and greenery, it's the same everywhere else. Clothes and shoes? All these are black, grey and white with a little bit of dark colors like red and blue. Furniture? The same, black, grey, white and dark colors. Home interiors? The same. 

Everything now is just corporate. Every piece of art is alegriaart. r/fuckalegriaart. The weird proportions, colors, etc. are fucking boring, bland, weird and suck your soul out, they look shitty.   

Clothes now break after a few months or years even when you stay the same size. When you buy phones and computers, they seem top notch but after a few years, they seem like an impediment to communication. The only things changing in PCs are the tiny things in the corner. Too bad, you can't replace it, every new model has a different shape, so you need to chuck the whole thing and buy a new one. Phones don't change much or even at all from one generation to another, like iPhones but also pretty much all phone brands. 

Grocery stores are dirty and messy, there are store pallets and boxes everywhere. 

The content of social media is dopamine activators. Most TikToks, YouTube Shorts and Instagram reels nowadays are AI generated. Even if they aren't, they're made to be colorful and attractive. They bombard you with information and entertainment before you even analyze it. YouTube videos are now mostly around-20-minute videos with clickbaity-and-colorful-and-flashy thumbnails and titles. They are bombarding you with BUT FIRST, LIKE, SUBCRIBE, CLICK THE BELL AND FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM! THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY TOTALLY-UNRELATED-COMPANY-THAT-IS-PROBABLY-SOMEHOW-RELATED! LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION! Social media and forum and game moderation mostly sucks. Forums that didn't suck are dead, while those that didn't are half alive and with a caste of VIP users and moderators shitting on any question because it was already posted, because they don't like the thing you hate, or for any other BS. They'll give you a warning or outright ban you because you asked for links, or anything.           

If you buy things, you don't own them. Computer software, games, music and books are just licenses to use stuff. Everything is copyrighted and you can get sued and your video taken down for copyright claims, even if they're fake. 

Streaming platforms are just trash. They cancel good shows and remove good movies while the bad ones stay. They make you pay for stuff that should be free. Even if you pay, you are bombarded with ads. 

Games bombard you too. Even if they're paid for, you still have micro transactions. Moderation sucks. Even if the game sucks, the studio will blame anything but themselves. Things that should be in the base game, are in paid DLCs. Everything is paid for.

The poor influence from big names are much easier to access nowadays, people take in this information and become manipulated by fools. The children in school are much too fast, wanting to be what they see on their phones, the over sexualizing and stoner culture persuading kids to follow these ways.

I'm sick of the women who make their career O.F. and the fact they want a man to be already fully established at the age of 18! I'm sick of the fact people who are Christians are now criticized due to the few religious folks who committed crimes, I'm tired of the teachers who don't GAF about their job, and only became a teacher because it was a last option. Everyone wants to be depressed nowadays, even the people who are clearly living great, I'm tired of LGBTQ+ communities who force people to love their ""genders"" I care about the individual, not their sexual preferences, I'm tired of BLM protest, causing destruction instead of trying to put good light on black people, my people. I'm tired of the feminist influencing women to follow ways influenced by men, all this nudity and sexualizing that feminist push was already pushed by men, something that was supposed to die out, something that isn't positive.

According to Public Health's article ,“Just How Harmful Is Social Media? Our Experts Weigh-In.” social media can affect peoples' mental health and confidence which could worsen their way of how they view society and worsen disorders people might have.

Coming from personal experience, sometimes when I see people who look like models, I compare their pictures to my current self, and being a bigger person, it makes me feel insecure about my appearance. Also as an artist, when I upload my artwork on social media, not only I notice small errors, but I also look at other artists getting more likes than me and I think to myself ""Is my art bad, What am I doing wrong?""

""For those vulnerable to developing an eating disorder, social media may be especially unhelpful because it allows people to easily compare their appearance to their friends, to celebrities, even older images of themselves.""

Social Media can leave a negative impact on people but also leave positive impacts too

In the same article, Mellins stated social media can be used to help teens find out who they are. For introverted people, social media can be a great way to find new people

I've been diagnosed with autism since I was in daycare, and when my parents told me I was diagnosed with it I didn't think anything of it. But as I got older, I noticed how much its effecting me. For a while, I knew about the basic facts about autism, but I wanted to get more info. I went on Instagram and found many posts about autism (masking, stimming, need for routine, etc.) and it helped me get a better understanding about my disability and made me feel relieved that I'm not the only one who goes through the same problems

""For young people, social media provides a platform to help them figure out who they are. For very shy or introverted young people, it can be a way to meet others with similar interests.""

anyway. My wife and I are both early Gen z and have been talking about what we want to be different for our kids and the biggest thing we have both discussed is our hatred of the modern education system.  
Our biggest problems are: (you can skip to the **tldr** if you want)  
  
-Lack of Real-World skills (think budgeting/cooking/trades skills etc.) yes we both know there is some of this but we don’t think it’s accessible especially since when we were in school all these “extra” classes were at the same time… first period… but the two of us were in band at that time and didn’t want to give that up.
  
-Lack of “personalization”. We both know personalizing a student’s education is tough when you have classes of 500+ students but we both felt like we could have been pushed farther in school and we weren’t. (For example by 4th grade I was doing pre-algebra because I was teaching it to myself online but I couldn’t get taught anything like that at school)  
  
-Bullies, in school I especially saw how bullies get away with treating other kids like shit but the second someone fought back they were “both” being problematic and the victim would get in just as much trouble as the known bully. We don’t want our kids to deal with this kind of shit from school administration.

**TLDR: No life-skills, unpersonalized, bullies suck.**

What do you think about homeschooling your kids one day? I know there are downsides to it that I didn’t mention but I need to stop stalling on my work I’d love to hear some of your pros/cons and just generally what you think. **if you are a younger Gen Z still in school I’d love to hear what you think could be different too**

My goodness… I don’t play anymore but there are SO many memories attached to Call of Duty: playing with my brothers and friend. 

Summer where all we did was play endless rounds of Zombies (don’t do that anymore) and my obsession with modeling my play style after Pamaj and Spratt. 

My first COD was BO2, and stopped at the most recent Modern Warfare. 

I obsessed and loved it. Legit had a fantasy of being in the CDWL 😭😂

After getting VERY good with sniper rifles ( ❤️ Locus) thanks to the above YouTubers, it’s all I stuck with. 

My favorite game mode was Fracture in BO3. 

My play style changed somewhat when I saved up for and bought a Scuf Infinity controller with what I saved from the first 2 checks of my first job. Somehow justified dropping $200 on a controller when I made $9.xx/ hour.
But I still have my whole setup. 

I also had THE wireless Sony headset. I could definitely hear you from a mile away (surround sound there came in clutch during S&D)

1cacrc7,2024-04-22 14:50:18,"Does it bug anyone else when older generations claim that financial struggles haven't changed across generations, from housing to groceries?","My uncle recently passed away on March 1st, 2024. He served in the Vietnam War, then worked hard for many years and was able to purchase a home, raise a family, and live a comfortable, even fulfilling life. Going through his stuff with my mom and his niece (who inherited the house), we found the original blueprints – this modular home cost just $16,000!

He wasn't rich. He worked at EG&G Rotron, then spent 35 years at the Mohawk Mountain House in New York before health issues forced him to retire in 2021. But through it all, somewhere between his time in the Army and the Navy and before 1977, he helped build a church that's still active today. He provided for his family, had hobbies like his Xbox 360 (and loved shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, and King of Queens), and never seemed to be worried about money. He embodied a certain version of the American Dream.

These days, it's more expensive than ever to simply afford to live.  An article I read said you need to make $111,738 a year to live comfortably in New York. Compare that to the minimum wage, $15/hour, which amounts to only $31,200 annually.  My uncle's story highlights how out of reach that basic comfort has become. 

His life was interesting, and I wish I'd known more to ask him about it. But the point is, it was a great life, well-lived. You didn't need endless possessions to have a fulfilling life. He had the necessities – a roof over his head, food to eat, clothes on his back, and even his favorite shows on DVD (we found most of The Big Bang Theory collection, except seasons 6 and 12!).

Sadly, so many today struggle, and older generations (even my dad, a Gen-Xer) dismiss it with ""it's always been this way"". No, it hasn't. They like to say groceries were expensive back then too, and wages were lower, so the struggle is the same. But that's just not true. Wake up and look.  Even working two or three full-time jobs (if that were humanly possible), I'd still barely come close to living comfortably.  Is virtually impossible to do that today.

1caj9ju,2024-04-22 19:08:32,Why Doesn't Gen Z Drink?,"I posted this on the r/millenial sub but curious to hear from you guys actually as well as hear how opinions differ....

As a millenial drinking culture was big in high school and college but surprisingly for Gen Z it isn't. This is talked about a lot and generally agreed to be a healthy choice and a positive thing and I think it is ie less DUI's, drinking isn't necessarily horrible for you in moderation but probably isn't the healthiest of activities. In some ways the lack of the community and socializing that comes with drinking could probably even be seen as a negative.

I see this mentioned a lot but never really see reasons given, I was thinking about this while driving today and came up with 3 reasons why Gen Z doesn't drink...

Phone Cameras Back when I was in HS and college there were no cameras on phones. Worst case scenario you had to worry about someone taking a blurry throwaway camera pic of you. There were plenty of mornings I woke up with a traffic cone in bed with me, missing a shoe and aside from wondering oh man did I do something stupid anything would be pretty quickly forgotten. Today with cellphone cameras and even more so social media one bad decision lives forever. I do wonder if young people are wise/mature enough to realize this but it could be a reason.

Cancel Culture Today people really need to walk on tiptoes, say one bad thing whether you misspeak, said in jest or maybe even say something nasty while drunk but in todays world saying one wrong thing can lose you friends and get you cancelled. I think in all areas of life we tread much more carefully in regards to what we say, this could also be a reason.

Less Connection The last reason I think is probably the one most people assume is the case which is just that younger people are less social, people today report having less friends than people of a similar age in the past, people report being lonelier, less people are involved in sports teams and organized activities and more people just play video games at home, even those with friends often engage with them on xbox live or social media.

Obviously people change, every generation is different, people do different things but its weird how since pretty much the dawn of humanity people have drank, every generation from probably the 20s if not earlier had like a college culture, Ive seen the old ""party"" images on Reddit of colleges in the 30s.

I don’t think anybody’s researched this but I’m sure extended amounts of failure to sleep 8 hours minimum in your teens very negatively affects your adulthood. It’s like we’ve already been screwed to begin with. Teens naturally go to sleep later than any other age group because of our hormones, why won’t schools accommodate for that?

1ca2psp,2024-04-22 05:22:14,I blocked my dad today. I had enough.,"THIS IS NOT A TROLL POST

I (16M) have been in contact with my dad since March of 2022. I (secretly) met him once in 2023. During that time I realized that something is a little “off” about him. This started to become more apparent after he told me some heinous things. He has called me a f*ggot and a p*ssy since he suspects that I’m gay. I confronted him about it, but he said not to worry about it since that’s just how guys talk to each other (???). I’ve never had that many male friends growing up, but I find this strange. I do not live with him at all - I live with my mom. I’m not able to discuss my sexuality with anyone in my immediate family since they are catholic. I tried to bring it up with my grandmother, but, before I could really say anything, she said that gay people go straight to hell when they die. So, for now, I’m in the closet, and have been for a very long time. Anyway, here are some more of the things he has said. Let me make it clear: I DO NOT SHARE ANY OF THESE VIEWS WITH HIM. Here is a list of the things he’s said to me:

1) The holocaust was justified. He says that Jewish people are the enemy. He is a staunch Hitler supporter (!!!) 

2) He is incredibly homophobic and transphobic (unfortunately, very common in the black community, especially among black men). He supports the ban on homosexuality in Uganda. In addition, he says that the government should kill gay people. (He suspects that I’m gay since I was raised by a single mother and am not very “masculine”, but I haven’t told him anything) 

3) He is an Andrew Tate supporter. I’m not making this up. He’s in his 40s and I find this downright strange. My dad says that women are inferior to men and cannot be trusted. 

4) He insinuated that I’m stupid since I attend an underfunded school district (this is entirely out of my control)

I only just have a Real ID, I think it’s called. This also limits my options for jobs because I live in a really small town with very little businesses and I can’t really afford ride-shares right now.

I only just recently started treating my acne with Cerave stuff. I am really skinny but can’t really work out since I have no work out equipment and there are no gyms close to where I live (at least ones that are affordable). I want to be able to dress better but I really can’t afford a lot of clothes. As for my mental heath, I really struggle with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, low self-confidence, etc. I’m a mess mentally. I would like to go to a therapist but again, can’t afford it. Then there are personal hobbies and interests. I like gaming but I only have a Switch (and a phone obviously). I like writing poetry and stuff (really something keeping me stable). I love drawing (I’m still learning how to draw better but I also can’t afford art supplies right now. I want to learn to play an instrument but I obviously I can’t afford to buy an instrument.

From all the relationship threads its lacking in that sort of view (Hopefully or due to survivorship bias since I am looking at the top posts)

Have any of you guys experienced abuse from your partner? How many of you guys have been able to talk about it?Any time I have tried to speak about my experiences of abuse I get very downplayed by everyone around me. Be it family or friends.

I have had relationships where I have feared for my life, I have had many times of speaking-stage to a girl where she states she will self-harm/(kill her self)  if I stop speaking to her. I have had many times where I wished to not have sex and they respond in crying and tears, talking about how I dont love them anymore. It has made me very jaded and somewhat afraid of a relationship because of these experiences.

I have not been physically harmed to this but I have been mentally harmed, I have been to therapy about it but its somewhat deep rooted.

I think the lack of being able to speak about this openly is due to these factors: Gender roles - man is viewed as stronger than a girl so that a girl couldnt harm a man; Men arent allowed to speak about their feelings - its less normalised and not in public view that people go through this, its unkown how many men go through this; People use this as a reactionary arguement to disvalue womens experiences - it just makes people angry when anyone really speaks about it.

We would spend a lot of time at the beach going up to girls and hang out with random group of teenagers

The horizon ushers in the shadow of his hostel building — he ducks under shade, sauntering towards his room. His keys jingle with metallic mirth as he unlocks his double door.

1c9h1tg,2024-04-21 12:47:10,Does the world feel overwhelmingly apathetic to anyone else?,"Maybe this is too broad of a statement, maybe this is too big of a topic. Idk, but it's been haunting me. 

The more time I spend on social media the more it seems people really don't care about others. Or that their actions / words have consequences on the other end of a screen. And not just screens, or social media. I'm not saying the internet or phones are bad. 

What I've found most disturbing lately is internet trends which turn an individual human being into an ""NPC"" which that idea is inherently dehumanizing. 

Every person you see isnt a background character, or a side character. Every person you see isn't some piece of code written for a line of dialogue you hear in passing. Every line, every spoken word by every human has layers of personal information and lived experiences and unknown context baked into that foundation. Every person you see in public has a life as intricate as yours. Every person in this world is uniquely individual, and different, BUT at the same time, so similar.

It's been really popular recently to harass people In public for internet points or laughs without any thought for the person on the receiving end. I'm sure you've all seen those videos of guys going into stores and screaming, or yelling at someone then acting dumbfounded when they get in trouble. As if they cannot fathom their actions have consequences. If not check out r/imthemaincharacter for a perfect example of what I'm talking about.

It's this general state of apathy that has seemed to be spreading like wildfire through our little screens. And again, I'm not saying ""phones bad. The internet bad."" But I am pointing out that they have flaws, as there is never anything that doesn't have flaws (just like humans). 

Another thing, it seems others can't accept people for being who they are. We all have preconceived ideas and biases about the way things are and the ""proper"" way people ""should"" act. Obviously mine our that we shouldn't harass other people in public when it's likely they just want to be left to go about their business. While some others might believe that it doesn't matter because in the grand scheme of things nothing matters, so we can do whatever we want, and no one will be any different. 

Also looksmaxxing is so fucked. So is the other subs like r/rateme, where the quality of a person's value is placed only upon their exterior features. While no one in those subs considers the interior, or mind, which is the thing that literally runs every minor thing we do. It's as if you cannot be loved now if you do not fit a standard. Standards have always been in place, and especially held unfair over young woman for centuries. But with the internet anyone with a little time and access to wifi can uphold that unfair standard for young women, and give feedback in an unqualified position to do so.

Which leaves a lot of young women very insecure about their looks, and trying to fit a certain idea of what they ""should be."" When they shouldn't try to be anything except themselves. ALSO! Before anyone says anything, the same can be said for men but it is not as great of an issue. The standard for men is also inhibiting to young men, especially young men that don't fit the stereotypes that are expected of men. (This is also part of what's called the male loneliness epidemic.) 

We have all been groomed in one way or another to believe on a subconscious level that romance, or love, or relationships, or personality, or presentation have a distinct ""way they should be"" but that couldn't be any further than the truth. Everything is so nuisanced. That's like being told when you're a baby that every fruit you come across will be an apple, and if you come across anything else, its not an apple. So when an orange begins to grow, or a banana shows it's curves people will throw it to the side because it's ""not how apples are supposed to be.""


Another thing, as I state these opinions, and have stated these opinions before, I have / will get ridiculed and dismissed because of my personal point of view. I don't see why we can't read someone's take, evaluate it, and give a response that isn't baked in contempt or defensiveness. If you have a different opinion than I do, PLEASE SHARE IT! I'd love to hear it, I'm learning every day and I know I don't get everything right. No one ever gets everything always right. So I am learning, and we all are. So if I'm wrong, or you disagree, I'd love to hear what you have to say of you're willing to have a discussion about it. But if you're just attacking an opinion without any backing, or evidence just because you disagree with it then that's very counter productive.

 I see these comments everywhere. All across the world of the internet. We can't agree to disagree anymore, because we hate we don't agree with. We can't learn each other's perspective when we're too busy hiding in our own. 

Even now, after writing this all down, I don't think I fully got my point across, but I want to know what you all think about the feelings of modern day people, and your perspective of how they view others. 

Anyway I'm tired of thinking at this very moment, but I'm gonna go take a nap, so I'll be back eventually. Peace.",9,4,0.75,GenZ,9,Sunday,Afternoon

So just a few hours ago there were supposed to come guests. Father asked us to come and help clean the home a bit. My sister just plainly and simply complained “I don’t want for them(the guests) to visit.”

I did a double take cuz as far as we were told, the guests were already on their way. Even if we could cancel, we couldn’t.

Dad did a double take too and laughed without humour. We just all shrugged and started cleaning.

So the guest came and went and my sister was doing homework and mom went and asked “why you don’t ever tell us anything from school?”. Previously dad told my sister that it was rude and very…bad(?) of her to say smth like that. Sister just told that she was just expressing her opinion.

Now she’s crying(?) about how parents’ words are contradicting themselves because they’re asking her to tell things but did bot like her sharing her opinion. I calmly(a bit sarcastically) explained to her that there’s a difference between telling how was school and sharing your opinion. She instead told me “Mhm, I’m listening” in a completely bored and unimpressed tone and kept on doing her homework.

And no, I'm not talking about naming kids ""rhyker"" and ""stephaneigh"" and ""charleigh-annye"", I'm talking about old school names.

It might be an unpopular opinion, but there are way too many Ryans, Aidans, Dans, Johns, Roberts etc, Who are my age. Obviously if you want to name your kid after a parent or grandparent or somebody, then that's all fine and well, but if you don't have any preference, go with something cool that'll stand out.

I'm talking about bringing back names like ""oliver"" and ""percival"" and ""beverly"". When was the last time you met somebody named Beverly? Stuff like ""Bruce"" or ""richard"". These names are perfectly fine, they've just fallen out of fashion for no reason at all.

Names like Burgess, Uriah, Lucille and Alice. There are tons of names from the middle ages and biblical times that are absolutely Metal AF, all of which have perfectly fine shortened nickname versions of themselves. It's crazy how nobody is naming their kids them, like Oziras or Abner or Absalom. Man absalom is like the coolest thing I've ever heard. Dude if somebody walked up to me and was like ""hi, I'm absalom"" I'd be like hey bro, what kingdom do you rule or something.

Or at the very least, we gotta start giving kids with boring names, cool nicknames, like buster, or weevil, or bugsy. Like get weird with it. Make it silly.

Why is it that even this generation are so insistent on keeping these laws, when so many other countries prove that life is safer without guns?

1c9yb9b,2024-04-22 01:21:24,How we feeling about the pro gun post?,"As you all would say, I’ll bite.

I’m shocked how many people here are pro gun. In your replies, please tell me what country you are from. Here we go:

It is a uniquely American phenomenon to believe a weapon is a right. It is not a right. You do not “deserve” a gun. You should be a very special, trained person to even be allowed NEAR a gun. You will not overthrow your government that has missiles and helicopters and masses of police forced with your handguns and semi auto rifles and tacticool gear you bought on Amazon. Source? We are being oppressed every day in America and guns haven’t helped that. (Homelessness is spiking. A president is on trial for the first time EVER, and he is about to win the presidency. I don’t see you rioting with your guns and winning? A few of you three stones at the wall on Jan 6, and for all the wrong reasons, and did you win? Did you fight a war? No. You got thrown in jail and laughed at.)

Moreover, I completely respect hunting rifles. It’s a big country, and hunting is better for the environment and cheap. Hunt away. But do it with a bolt action. You have to take a class and pass a test to drive a car, because cars can kill people. Guns are DESIGNED to kill people. You should be willing to take a test, have a license and use a weapon that is safe, and single fire. You don’t need a minigum to kill some deer.

Next guns are TERRIBLE for self defense. You will miss. You could hit somebody else. At close range, you might not have time to draw and fire. How many of you have even used a gun for self defense? Maybe a few of you, but waving it around doesn’t count. That makes YOU the problem. Get a taser. Get some pepper spray. Learn to fight. The only thing you need a gun for is to “defend” against others with guns. Get rid of all the guns, no reason for other guns.

Next, even if all the above wasn’t true, how can you possibly ignore the insane amount of children that have died for your toys? Your glorified tasers you’ll never use? 1000 per year? More? You are selfish if you think that guns being “cool” is more important than lives. I love guns. They are so sick. As a kid I had all the air soft guns. Then I realized what they did, and I ditched the hobby. Then my friends died in a shooting, and I realized the game wasn’t worth it. 

Lastly, guns create a state of paranoia that is uniquely American. Walking around the store worried about the next shooting. Dropping kids off at school worried they’ll be next. My local grocery store got shot up. I worked there for Fs sake. Ten people dead. My coworkers dead. I was never the same. Did any good guys with guns stop them? No they ran and hid. The town was ruined for years. The more paranoid we get, the more guns we buy, the more dangerous it gets, the more paranoid we get, it repeats. 

Ask yourself, is it worth it? 


Go ahead, rip me apart. I dont care anymore.


Edit: I do know that guns are a right in America. I am an American. I just do not like the fact that they are and think it’s silly to call them such.

1c8bhwl,2024-04-19 23:39:12,I don’t understand the hate for sex scenes in movies,"This is not just address to the recently made post, but I’ve seen several posts about this across Reddit and in this sub. A size-able amount of people on this site seem to dislike and even want to outright ban sex scenes in movies. These aren’t pre-teen children or religious Gen-X or boomers saying this; they’re your average young adult internet users, which surprises me.

Didn’t we, along with the previous generation, grow up to buck against censorship, puritanism and just purity culture in general? I understand that there’s media that exists out there that is gratuitous with its  use of sex and nudity (which can be annoying), but we’re all adults right? We understand that this is just art? And art is sometimes things you like and dislike?

I don’t think anyone should be forced to watch anything they’re uncomfortable with. If you don’t like it then by all means avoid it. However, like I said, a considerable amount of people say that this stuff should be banned in media all together. The arguments for doing so don’t make much sense to me and can be pretty much used against everything in media.

“This is irrelevant to the story, unnecessary and not needed.” or “This could’ve been implied instead of shown.”
These arguments can be used for any action scenes, emotional scenes, violent scenes etc. Fighting scenes aren’t really necessary and can be implied, high-speed chases aren’t necessary and can be implied, so on and so forth. I think people forget that what is necessary to a piece of art or media is up to the interpretation of the artist AND audience(s). They also forget that human sexuality can be pretty artistic itself.

The thing I find the most wild is people that connect being okay with sex scenes or liking them to somehow being a porn addict? I think if your mind jumps to this conclusion, you probably have a pretty unhealthy relationship with sex or have some deep insecurities you’re projecting.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: Thank you for all the discussion on the post y’all! I appreciate it. I’ve noticed a few things from all the responses so far though:

1. I feel like a lot of people that commented only read the title or didn’t fully understand the post. I know why sex in media might make some people uncomfortable, I just don’t understand why sex seems to be singled out in this aspect when people’s complains can logically be applied to everything else in a movie, therefore having it cut out. But I don’t nearly see the same level of outrage about over the top gore or action as I do sex

2. A lot of you guys commenting are VERY young, much younger than I expected. When a lot of the responses have reasons such as “I don’t want things to be awkward with my family”, this indicates that a lot of people that hold this opinion probably aren’t any older than 17 years old. This kinda says a lot as to why I’m getting the kind responses to this post that I’m seeing. I am about to be 26 for reference.

3. A lot of people are saying things like, “It’s unnecessary”, “It doesn’t advance the plot”, “It’s lazy” and so on. On top of what I said about those sentiments being able to be applied to literally any other aspect in a movie, it also shows a failure to understand art and how some people can value things in different ways than you. What is necessary, advances the plot, and is lazy are things that are entirely subjective not only to the audience; BUT the person making the film or piece of art in the first place. Like I said though, the age of people in the responses and the inability to see other perspectives is probably at play here.",953,477,0.68,GenZ,10,Friday,Night

I have acquaintences at school that I talk to about hobbies and work sometimes, but they're all dismissive and I can tell they're not really interested in what I have to say. I have autism and aspergers BTW.

I haven't had a real friend since 2014-2019 when I went to Four Oaks, and even then we weren't able to communicate outside of Four Oaks and we haven't seen each other since 2019.

I rarely see friends from high school around town, but I'm never able to socialize with them.

There's a girl at school I have a crush on, but I can tell she's not interested. I've never had these kinds of feelings until recently, and I'm not interested in a serious relationship, yet I still want a girl I can hang out with and cuddle sometimes. Sex would be nice.
Is that what a friend-with-benefits is? I don't know. :( Please don't hate me, I really don't know what I'm looking for.
Yes I'm a virgin if you can't tell, which bothers me.

It's been affecting me mentally and physically. I've hardly been able to get any work or other activites done, I feel constantly tired and upset no matter how much sleep I get or if I'm hungry or tired or not. (Doesn't help that I get super depressed when I'm hungry).

I've been seeing a therapist about traumatic events from my past, so I got THAT going for me.

Stupid reason: I'll be honest, I want an iPhone 4 because it's nostalgic and reminds me of my childhood, I'm admittedly stuck in my past and I like old things that make me feel... yk, comfortable.

So sorry if I didn't make any sense.  I'd appreciate the most truthful answers thanks guys! :)",22,2,0.6,GenZ,9,Sunday,Night

Now, growing up I remembered during Thanksgiving we had a HUGE get together. The classic movie/TV show thanks giving. Family would fly out to say hello for a few days during the holidays. 

After I turned 19 I joined the military so I couldn't go Home, and after I got out I had contract work so I couldn't go home. This is the first year I went back home since I was 18 during the holidays for work (I'm 26/27 birthday month) and MANNNNNN this year was depressing AF 

I went to the Old folks home, we where the only ones to go. It was my immediate family only. When walking back and forth from my Grandpas room and the eating hall I heard so many depressing conversations. 

A old women invited her whole family no one showed up. 

Some people had no one to begin with. 

Old people crying, you never want to see REAL OLD PEOPLE CRYING 

Even my family it's kinda of fucked up. My grandpa (black family) had 12 brothers and sisters. My grandpa always took care of everyone. No one could say anything bad about my grandpa. No one, he ALWAYS got shit done. Then when he got hurt no one came to help him at all! It was just us. 

Now I'm thinking, ""damn, my grandpa did everything right and still doesn't have anyone taking care of him"" and it's not just him. So many old people are like that. just no one wants them anymore. That's terrifying!!!

1c875lv,2024-04-19 20:34:00,How are y’all getting over feeling like the pandemic stole the end of your childhood?,"Howdy, so I’m currently 21f. I was a junior in high school when lockdown hit in my state of Ohio. As you can imagine, my senior year of high school was spent in a mess of online classes and not knowing what the future looked like. I didn’t have a whole lot of academic help at home like I did at school, so my previously decently upkept grades plummeted and it feels like I’ve struggled heavily with motivation and life participation in general since (well except for the 8 months post-lockdown where I temporarily moved away from home and found things much easier to cope with. But that’s a whole other complicated story. 

Anyway, I won’t get too deep into playing my violin over any of that, since we’re all dealing with it. But in a lot of ways it feels like lockdown never ended. It feels like everything (people) are a million miles away and I’m afraid to connect for fear of rejection. I know it’s stupid, and I hate that I’ve let myself get to this point. But In many ways the more I’ve moved into adulthood the more I feel like I need to find some way to get closure for my childhood since it never got its own proper ending. Idk. Do any other Gen-z that are around my age have tips for dealing with this? I just need to find some possible way to show my brain that it’s childhood is over and it needs to move onto adulthood. The whole process of doing that got interrupted in March of 2020 and I haven’t recovered, much to my own shame. 

ETA: not that it’s important for the *general* topic at hand, but it is important for how it relates to me. I was diagnosed with ADHD in the first grade and I come from alcoholics who weren’t always the greatest at guidance despite having lots and lots of love in their hearts. So without my teachers that last year and 1/3 of high school, I was just lost. And the ADHD and parents thing is why I feel like I always would’ve been lost in adulthood to some degree, but I think the pandemic made my issues relating to that 10x worse. 

ETAx2: I probably shouldn’t have added that because it’s not particularly relevant. But deleting it after adding it feels like the wrong thing to do. So the “ETA” is here now but feel free to ignore it if you’d like to. ",120,118,0.94,GenZ,15,Friday,Evening

I earn $22 per hr and it doesn’t feel like a lot. I know it doesn’t sound bad but $22 in 2024 has the same purchasing power as $18.01 in 2019. It’s not bad, but really not that good. I also work 36 hrs a week and I can’t go above that because my schedule is strict. 

I work in a kitchen and most of everyone else is earning at least $24, some may earn as high as $28-29 . Almost everyone I know lives in a apartments, many have to rely on the bus because they can’t afford a car. 

Anyone who lives in the west coast has a similar experience? My online friends tell me I’m killing it at $22/hour but they live in other parts of the US.

1c7t5l1,2024-04-19 10:06:23,"No, overpopulation isn't the problem and immigration won't fix declining fertility rates - a response to my previous post    ","I got a lot of responses to [my previous post about declining fertility rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/s/BxrqqW8HEF) about how immigration will fix this and there's too much people and we hurt the environment. 

1. Immigration won't fix declining fertility rates. Most countries will reach fertility rates below the replacement level of 2.2 kids per woman by 2100. The only way this would work is the rich countries keeping Africa, Asia, South America and Oceania poor so the educated would emigrate to rich countries and start a new life. Kind of an immoral thing to do.   

#2. There's not too much people, but a waaay too big missalocation of resources between the rich and poor. The myth of overpopulation is killing us. 

Let me introduce you to the [Global North and Global South divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South?wprov=sfla1). 

#People in the Global North, AKA blue countries, consume too much resources, energy and contribute the most to climate change and climate related disasters, ecosystem collapse and mass extinction and topsoil loss and bear the smallest brunt of them, while those in the Global South AKA the red countries, consume too little resources and energy, causing poverty and deprivation and contribute the least to climate change related disasters and the biggest brunt of ecosystem collapse and mass extinction and topsoil loss while bearing the biggest brunt of them.   

We can easily maintain 8 billion people or even 12 billion, the projected world population by 2100 if we reduce our overconsumption of energy and resources as well as our brunt on the environment, not just emissions, and spread energy,  resources, the environment and wealth more equally. 

#We can't maintain 8 billion people or 12 billion people if everyone consumes the same as an average American, German or Australian. 

#If everyone lives and consumes the same as an average person in the Global North, we'd need 5 planets, and we only have 1. We need to radically reduce our overconsumption of energy, resources and our brunt on the environment, not just emissions.                                                      

If you think overpopulation is the problem, I've got an ideology for you. It should scare you. It's called [Ecofascism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecofascism). It believes climate change, ecosystem collapse, mass extinction and other environmental problems are caused by overpopulation, especially by those poor people. They want to eliminate most of the poor.    

The world population will reach 12 billion people in 2100 and then level off or fall down.          ",216,174,0.74,GenZ,19,Friday,Morning

-__Our governments are run by walking skeletons who are out of touch with the common person__

-__Everything is expensive as shit, the economy is terrible__

-__Most people have to live with their parents because they can’t afford to make it on their own__

-__AI is slowly creeping into life and it’s actually terrifying__

-__There’s an ongoing genocide being broadcasted live in HD and most people in power don’t really seem to care__

-__You have no choice but to become a cog in the capitalist machine, or else you’ll be homeless and unable to live__

It’s just… how do you remain positive and hopeful in light of these sorts of things? I know the most likely response is “get off the internet” but some of this stuff still affects me in my day to day life. I graduate college in a year and there’s no way I’ll be able to live on my own afterwards. 

I love art, I love creating things, I have a bunch of hobbies and I know exactly who I am as a person. I just hate the system that governs life in the modern day and it just bums me out and sucks all the life and joy out of me. I’m not an economist but I just know there HAS to be a better system out there than this. There’s no way this is the optimum one.  Literally the only material thing I want in life is to own a small home just so I can have that baseline security, but even that seems so out of reach during these times. 

It’s gotten to a point where I find myself fantasizing about getting cancer so I can be free of this nonsense and not have to participate in the game anymore.

1c8zoju,2024-04-20 20:29:57,why texas is the best state 💪🤠🐴.🦅🏈 🌮🌵🏜️,"this is half shitpost and half geniune and idk which is which

here are some reasons why texas is the best state (if you didn't already know and you somehow need convincing)

1. texas is big

go big or go home? we always go big. even if we did go home, we would still be in texas. largest state in the lower 48, you could drive from maine to south carolina in the same distance it takes to go to texas. beat that, california.

2.  diversity

texas is literally one of the most diverse states in the lower 48 and accurately represents the demographics of the US population. all the people saying texas is full of old white men have literally never been to texas. especially if you go to the cities. i would spontaneously combust if the demographics of my school changed significantly. theres a reason that i want to go to *Brown* University.

3. food

this is the most important reason on this list. every cuisine in the world, texas has. if i want to get banging indian food, there's a whole district for that. if i want to shop at the chinese market, there's a district for that too. and tex mex? i tried tex mex in the north once. y'all don't even know what tex mex is. Please, come to texas just to try the tex mex. We also have the best brisket and BBQ in the country. also whataburger > in n out. bucees and gas stations that are one stop shops during road trips.

 also chick fil a. i could not imagine living in a state with less then 100 chick fil as. they're literally on like every street corner here. we have over 3 times as many as california, at 460 for the most of any US state. chick fil a for the win.

4. less open antisemitism.

5. texas history

we were our OWN country for a while (not some fake ass republic that lasted like 25 days), and we had cowboys.

6. pop culture

we're literally famous for cowboys and the wild west and rodeos and horse riding. there are so many songs dedicated to texas and texas is probably the state with the most recognition outside of the US bc we're just that cool. our state literally is the best in the universe! (texas is the best state in the us, the us is the best country in the world, and the earth is the only planet confirmed to have life in the universe) beyonce is from texas.

7. driving

driving on highways in texas will make sure that you're prepared for driving anywhere in the us. my californian cousin was literally complaining about the roads the whole time and going at some slow ass crawl speed, when i've been accustomed to the texas way literally from the moment i popped out the womb. also you have great majestic feats like the Katy freeway and the high five interchange 

8. wind power

texas produces the MOST renewable energy of any states, and its not close. 

[https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/these-states-use-the-most-renewable-energy](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/these-states-use-the-most-renewable-energy)

9. niceness and language

texan hospitality is a thing. yes, people are loud and brash. but they're friendly. like going from texas to any other state and back, its literally like day and night how people are. like in texas they'll ask you how your day has been or say good morning to you as you're walking past, and people are just really hospitable. also y'all. Y'all'd'n'tve, y'all'd've, y'all'd, y'all'd'a all hold special places in my heart.

1c8ypnv,2024-04-20 19:47:28,I cheated on my online boyfriend because I didn't know how real the relationship was.  I regret this so much,"My whole life I couldn't fathom cheating.  It seemed like the cowards way out, a betrayal that only awful people would do.  Maybe that's true and I've become that person.

A while back I met a guy on an online game.  We started to play together and eventually talked more and more, only through text.  Once I found out he was into guys, I told him I was too and we soon started flirting.  I think I was 21 and he was 20.  Neither of us had been in a relationship before.

We eventually agreed to be boyfriends.  We knew it'd be hard because he was from South America, and me from North America.  I also had a lot of trust issues early on.  Like whether he was being honest about things like his age, life, etc.  And we showed a couple pictures of ourselves but never shared our voice until way later on.

He was amazing to me with his words and thoughts, it was a cute time.  I feel bad looking back on it because he was very sweet.  I think I felt so unsure of our relationship and how real it was.  I didn't even know his name.  But I should have communicated these feelings I had about it.  Instead I was a coward and would talk to other guys on the apps to get a flirting/sexting fix.  While still keeping my fantasy land online boyfriend.  I acted terribly and whether our relationship was real or not, I still feel like it was cheating and I feel awful.  Especially because I still talk to the guy.  We agreed to be friends and game together.  This is such an ugly part of my life, I've felt awful for a long time for it.

Another difficult thing was I would tell him ""we're so young, if someone comes into your life locally and you want to pursue something, I understand."".  And I think me saying that made him feel like we'd never work out.  I was just scared of us wasting our youth on an impossible love.  It was also hard because he'd go days without talking to me.  We had our own lives to tend to on top of this relationship we were trying to make work.  But the days apart from him made me feel so insecure about our relationship.  It made me feel like he didn't want to talk to me.  Overall I think this was not a healthy way to go about dating somebody, and I have a lot to learn about respecting others.",7,0,0.23,GenZ,20,Saturday,Evening

I was listening to someone who's about 22 or so, and they said Gen Z has an issue with dealing in absolutes only. That nuance wasn't as embraced, likely due to social media.

Teens, celebrities, and influencers alike have been snapping up 20-year-old digital cameras to take lower-quality photos with high-quality vibes.

Ayo Edebiri’s 8.1-megapixel Sony Cyber-shot had a moment when The Bear actress handed it to her seatmate Carson Daly for safekeeping while she went onstage to accept her Emmy award. (Okay, so maybe cell phone photos aren’t entirely out—as you can see from the selfie Carson snapped—but they’re making room for their old-school brethren.)

Although an element of “everything old is new again,” is definitely at play here, there’s a legitimate reason why people aren’t buying new, inexpensive, good-quality compact point-and-shoot cameras: They don’t exist.

1c7iri4,2024-04-19 00:01:05,The government should encourage a healthy lifestyle/diet,"I’ve thought about this a lot. It really bothers me how the government does absolutely nothing (or close to nothing) to incentivise healthy living.  

A healthy person is a stronger, smarter, kinder one. If most people in society were as such, said society itself would be stronger, smarter and kinder. Yet, the government seems to completely neglect that.  

I believe that just like how the government has agencies and regulations that ensure meat and other ingredients are properly transported/hygienic (and they force this on restaurants/stores), the government should have agencies that evaluate a restaurants’ “healthiness”.  

Things such as nutrition, calories, macros, micros, protein and etc. would be accounted for.  

No current restaurant would be prohibited or banned, but the worse your food health is, the higher its taxed (much like cigarettes), and the more healthy it is, the higher it is incentivised (reverse taxed?).  

Examples (for easier comprehension):  

- McDonalds : Every article (except maybe salads) has a 50-100% tax.  

- Dairy Queen : 80-150% tax.  

- Steak Restaurants : 20-30% tax.  

- Fresh vegetables in grocery stores: 30-40% paid by government.  

- Meat/etc in grocery stores: 25-35% paid by government.  

These are examples. The point is that the vegetables and other healthy options price decrease will be partially paid by the extra tax from the unhealthy options.

*""Lying flat""* is a movement that originated from China, also known as ""tang ping"" in response to  the *996 work culture, involving working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week*. This is where one chooses to ""lie down flat and get over the beatings"" by pursuing a low-desire, more indifferent attitude towards life. We generally refer to this as a minimalist lifestyle.

*BaristaFIRE* is where the returns from your invested assets cover most, but not all of your living expenses, and you do work that you find enjoyable to make up for the difference and fund the rest of your lifestyle.

*CoastFIRE* is where you minimize your spending and invest as much as possible until you reach a target amount of savings that lets you “coast” toward an eventual retirement in your 60s. The “coast” part means that you keep working after you attain your target savings amount.

1c8edmm,2024-04-20 02:00:11,"For those who are over 20, Does anyone else feel uncomfortable being compared to older people and saying that they have more in common with them?","It's not like i'm trying to be so extremist, it's a topic that I would like to talk.

But it feels uncomfortable that they say that, for example, people aged 24-27 have more in common with people aged 50-55 than with people aged 20-21, just because at 20-21 one is still studying college and at 24-27 one is already working (recently working), and since someone who is 50+ yo is also working, they say that those who are 25 and 50 have more things in common.

In my case, It's as if they want to say that by finishing college, a year difference is very significant. Older people exaggerate, hoping that someone will skip 5 years or more in less than a month. Or because you turned 18 they expect too much than when you were 17.

Obviously I know the fact that someone at 50-55 is way different than someone at 24-27 for the reason that the first ones have more experience working while the second ones are just starting. I don't connect at all with people who are 20-30 years older than me, it's too much, ten years ago I was 14 and they around 45, during our adolescence, social networks grew and in-person interaction was disappearing, while in theirs, they had to work at a very young age and very few of them attended high school.

You may not be that uncomfortable, you will be ignoring them in any time as I often do, but being compared with older people and expecting a lot from you for just one year that elapses is that annoying? At least, you understand that feeling?",18,0,0.33,GenZ,26,Saturday,Night

1c88aqr,2024-04-19 21:20:38,Joining the Military was the Best Decision of my Life," To start off, this post may come off as some recruitment propaganda but it's not. Just some dude who started getting posts from here in his feed for the last 2 months. I see the shit that you guys deal with what seems to be on a daily basis and I couldn’t even imagine facing those situations right now.

Joined the Air Force during Covid because I wanted to start living life on my own/travel/start doing adult shit basically and enlisted. Now I'm some years in, going to college (for free btw) and really getting set up to have a career outside the military. I understand the military isn't for everyone, the stress of leaving home and or being held to some weird standards really does put a toll on people sometimes. Personally I really wanted it and it actually removed a lot of stress from my life lol. 

I just thought I should come on here and enlighten you all on some opportunities to escape the hell holes some of you seem to live in. 

1. We aren’t all killers - For the majority of us, it is literally just a job. For example, the majority of the Air Force fills some sort of admin position, not bombing or shooting shit.
2. Much more inclusive than before - I can’t speak for all branches on this, but I do feel the Air Force and Army at least. Any sort of illegal discrimination is an absolute no-no, people caught doing that will be destroyed so quick. The way I see it, it's as if you can get in trouble at work for being an asshole outside of it.
3. New family - We are all friends unless you're a bad person. I could sit there and bs with almost anyone in my unit. Cliques do form up but it's not like they aren't willing to be your friend
4. Basically guaranteed pay - I've never seem someone lose pay, but I've heard of people who have and they did some unusually fucked up things
5. Really forces you to self develop - I've learned how to really care for myself from joining. A lot of what seems to be bs you’ll find out later is actually really nice. For example, making the bed. I love having a made bed when I get home to wrap up cozy in. Another example, Physical Training (PT). Getting paid to be fit? Hell yeah.

As a 19yo who was scared of signing away to a college and getting locked into a degree I wouldn’t enjoy, joining the military was the best decision I could have made. I got to experience life and see what a majority of jobs I was interested in really do. I Just finished my AA and hope to be very close to finishing my bachelors before I separate. Got some job experience in a field that really grew on me, and although it feels like I'm starting my life of making real money a little late, it's better than hating every aspect of my life.

Again, not a recruiter here. Just some other dumbass who feels like they made 1 good decision.

The principal took it very seriously, and I had to try my hardest not to burst out laughing. When I was her age, I cut the cables of the PA system and hooked up my Walkman to play parts of ‘Love to Love You Baby.’

We did so many reckless things that it’s a miracle we’re still alive. We were also fortunate that no one filmed our foolish antics. One time, we went to a construction site and placed a dead cow in freshly poured concrete.

Affordability of homes in the US has become an enormous issue. Many of my peers (I'm in the younger half of millennials) have totally given up on the dream of homeownership because they don't think they will ever be able to afford it. We created Joy to help solve the affordability problem in the US.

Joy is a real estate agent, exclusively working with homebuyers. Joy can do anything a standard real estate agent can do (except meet in-person). She can schedule viewings, negotiate offers, coordinate inspections, ETC.

The best part about Joy is that she rebates 70% of her commission earned back to the homebuyer.

Example of how Joy works:

  
\- Homebuyer uses Joy to buy a $500,000 home  
\- Joy receives a 3% commission on this transaction, which is equal to $15,000  
\- Joy rebates 70% of this commission back to the homebuyer, equal to $10,500

  
The homebuyer can receive this rebate payment as cash, put it towards their down payment or buy down interest points to lower their monthly mortgage payment.

We have a 100 second intro video to Joy that you can find here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMxXAZdP5YA&t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMxXAZdP5YA&t=32s)

1c7z9zk,2024-04-19 15:10:49,Things to be optimistic about! ,"**Crime is going down now**

Violent crime hit a low point in 2014. But in 2015, it started drifting up again, and in 2020 it absolutely spiked. Many feared that America was entering a long-term period of elevated urban violence, like we did in the 1970s. But starting in 2022, something good started to happen — violence started to fall. It fell even more in 2023

**We’re making progress against climate change**

Green technologies have gotten cheaper at astounding rates, to the point where decarbonization is the smart economic option as well as the good environmental choice. At the same time, economic growth is generally shifting from manufacturing to services, especially online services, which are less carbon-intensive. As a result, emissions have been falling in the developed world, and decelerating across much of the developing world


**The U.S. economy is growing pretty fast**

When you look at international comparisons, America is actually doing really well. Most countries have struggled to grow at pre-pandemic rates in the post-pandemic era — this is especially true of European countries that suffered from the Russian gas cutoff, but it’s also true of places like Japan and Canada (and even China). The U.S. has powered ahead, even when you take higher immigration rates into account. 


**Younger generations are doing better than their parents**

In the 2010s, there was a big worry that the Millennial generation, and perhaps also Generation Z, would be uniquely hurt by the financial crisis and by other negative economic trends. But in the years since the pandemic, it’s become apparent that younger generations are — on average — doing very well economically.

Pokemon go I feel like was marketed towards teens/tweens (people who would prolly have a phone and be able to walk around but also have enough to time to waste walking around collecting pokemon)  I feel like that vast majority were young adults and kids. early 20 year olds were the oldest demographic that realistically would enjoy this and have enough time to be out and about collecting pokemon (considering most of them would have been walking around a lot during college) and kids around 6 were the youngest kids who could walk and understand how to play pokemon go. Because of that I feel like during the pokemon go crazy its mostly anyone who was ealry 20s or younger but could walk. This also would perfectly describe gen z cause the people who would have fit being 22-5 were literally the oldest genz/ zilliennials-the youngest gen z. I asked my younger z cousins who would have been 8 &7 at the time and they both remember playing pokemon go and the crazy in general (like the remember the whole event not just playing it, from masses of people trying to catch mew and other pokemon at the raids to the news stories of accidental deaths from not paying attention)

I feel like this is on those you just had to be there moments and all of gen z (for the most part) was there. Idk if this makes sense but the reason I thought of this is because every ""stage"" of gen z has their own personal you just had to be their moments.  the early gen z has vine from beginning to death, middle or ""core"" gen z has being a covid teen, late gen z has tiktok. but the difference between the ones mentioned and pokemon go is that like you had to be a teen to earliest like tween to fully experience them.

Some other events that I also feel are universal to gen z. (from most ""universal"" after pokemon to least imo)

-harambe/harambe memes (2016)

* avengers infinity war and end game (2018-2019)
* tiktok/charlie becoming popular (2019)

I ended up asking my dad why they did that. My dad is a refugee who grew up in an extremely rural and backwoods parts of an underdeveloped country. He said he didn't really *feel* super poor and that though they didn't have a lot of money, I was still going to be fed, clothed, sheltered and loved (even if everything was from the thrift) so it wasn't a tough decision for him to have kids at that stage. Because he was starved, unclothed, unsheltered, and was forced to leave his family as a child.

As a kid, I felt the effects of being poor, but 90% of it was just being jealous of my friends who had more materialistic items than me.

However the predicament for me at least is the inital conversations/approach. I dont have issues making friends and it just happens organically over time since it doesnt matter if I find them attractive and I can just talk to people organically over the span of a course in college for example. Dating wise ive just not had luck meeting people organically such as in college classes however and dating apps are rough (largely my fault since I suck at photos lmao). Bars are a no go for a while longer since im under 21 and im not the go out and club type either.

So, for GenZ women, how do you feel about being approached by similarly aged guys irl? 

If you are ok with it, how would you prefer to be approached or if you were a guy how would you approach yourself? 

What ways should you start the conversation? What types of things would make you guys most comfortable in the situation and make you react postively to the guy approaching you (aside from looks or inate attraction)?

If a guy you never met before were to approach you how should we get our foot in the door so to speak? (What ive struggled the most with on dating app coversations and irl convos most)",251,234,0.93,GenZ,11,Thursday,Night

Is it "" astroturfing ""when you are up front and repeatedly mention that you are a millennial with a GenZ son, and are not hiding that fact in any way? Even in my post history in GenZ, I mentioned my son is GenZ, not me. I have never pretended to be GenZ myself and make that pretty clear.

I was just accused of astroturfing because I am a millennial and discussing the impact of policies on my health and I was discussing the impact of those policies on my own GenZ son.  
When we lost out home, my GenZ son lost his home as well. When I almost died, he almost lost his mom.  The $400k in hospital bills, those are some of his hospital bills as well. The $3000 in medicine expenses are the combination of both his and my medication. I feel that these issues  are just as important to GenZ as they are to millennials. These issues impact every aspect of my GenZ son's life as well, so think it is worthy of discussion.

I'm interested to know if that is perceived as "" astroturfing"" as suggested or is it instead just an attempt to silence me because they don't like me sharing my experience or what I have to say?

Thanks for any input!

1c6s6yx,2024-04-18 02:20:59,Tik Tok is not good.,"I never used it until just recently since I have a fitness page on Instagram and I wanted to branch out to other platforms. 

I have quickly realised that a lot of the content on there is really borderline pornographic. As soon as I downloaded the app and scrolled through the stuff that’s there (stuff I hadn’t searched for or anything) I saw video after video of people in suggestive situations doing questionable dances/skits... Again, stuff that I had only just downloaded the app and saw.

I never engage in that stuff, I don’t even use the app other than to post videos straight from my Instagram. I was appalled to see this.

Tbh I didn’t think I’d see some of the stuff on there so upfront and in plain sight. The app is heavily used by young kids and it doesn’t sit right with me.

Some of the “trends” you hear about too are really nasty considering what they consist of, and the audience watching. 

I know of somebody who’s 9 year old daughter got in trouble at school because she was doing the WAP dance for a Tik Tok. That’s a 9 year old girl doing the Wet Ass Pussy dance for ANYBODY to see.

That’s not the first time I’ve heard of minors/underage children getting in trouble for the content they put out on there. It is a parenting issue as well, you should know what your kids are up to.

Look, I’m all for expressing yourself and being free to post what you want as long as it follows the guidelines. But many people on that platform push the boundaries too far and blur the line between entertainment and adult content. 

We aren’t stupid, we know what they’re doing and they know what they’re doing when filming. All angles used, trending sounds, clothing… it’s all intentional and I don’t think that’s good when you get people like the 9 year old girl who don’t know better and wanna copy.

Yes the parents need to do better, but so do content creators, knowing who the audience are on the platform.

I don’t know what can be done to fix this, it seems that for the most part the app is okay but it can also be a pedophiles playground and that shouldn’t sit right with anybody.

I’m asking a Gen Z sub what they think because they are the main ones who use the app.",91,52,0.71,GenZ,5,Thursday,Night

Gen Alpha content is worse, no?","At this point the ""Gen Alpha brain rot"" meme has become a little oversaturated, as I think we can all admit looking back that our childhoods weren't exactly filled with the pinnacle of intellectual thought either, but like... things have gotten worse, no?

I know nostalgia plays a large role in it, but if we turn off the needless generational warfare and nostalgia goggles, it's pretty bad, and I don't even think its Gen Alpha's fault either. I know we're the first generation to have grown up online, but Gen Alpha is really the first generation to be weened on algorithms and its been that way for a while. Elsagate was becoming a problem as far back as 2016 and more recently content farms on YouTube have once again started to proliferate to an insane degree. Since around then, the Jake Paul tier sludge of the content mill has only gotten worse and found new ways to seep into every level of kids entertainment.

Back in my day (God I feel old), even if things like *Fred* and *Annoying Orange* were kinda sugary and hyperactive, they still don't have that same hyper processed addictive feel of this new wave of content. They still were the work of one person or a small group of people that started making the content cause they thought it was funny. Sure Smosh or early PewDiePie weren't high brow content, but we didn't have anything quite on the level of the content farms or Cocomelon. There are growing movements in government to regulate [content like this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/02/children-safety-social-media-california/) and increased interest in studying the effect that parenting via these hyperactive programs can have on a kids development.

So with all that in mind, do we really just have rose-tinted glasses on or is there maybe some legs to the concern levied at Gen Alpha-centric content?

Given Gen Z’s approach towards mental health, do you think a major characteristic of Gen Z parenting will be high monitoring on our children’s mental health? Examples include putting kids through several screenings, being more concerned on what mental conditions their kid might have, and more kids going receiving some sort of treatment whether it be therapy or medications.

||My opinion: I feel like as a generation we’re scared of our future kids going through the mental health issues that we went through, such as feeling stigmatized and having undiagnosed/untreated mental conditions. With that, I wouldn’t be surprised if there are (unfortunately) Gen Z parents who frequently send their kid to autism tests (even if the kid doesn’t have it) because they’re paranoid that their kid will end up like them being undiagnosed until 21 and etc.||

Thoughts? I’m absolutely glad that we’ll most likely be more aware of our children’s mental health as parents, but I fear that some Gen Z parents will take it too far because of circumstances such as “being scared the kid will end up like them” and such.",281,497,0.94,GenZ,17,Wednesday,Night

1c5n09s,2024-04-16 18:10:48,People should be scared about declining fertility rates ,"I'm gonna bring data for Poland because I live there so I know how it's here and it's a wonderful example of HOW TO MAKE PARENTING A LIVING HELL.    

For starters, housing costs tens of times your entire yearly salary. One m² costs [6386 zł or 1565,14 USD](https://www.properstar.pl/poland/house-price) and [100 zł or 24 USD](https://www.properstar.pl/poland/house-price). And that's for [small apartaments](https://rentola.pl/en/listings/pokoje-dla-studentow-5343bf) built by real estate developers for profit. The more family friendly, bigger, walkable, older [commie blocks](https://poznan.nieruchomosci-online.pl/mieszkanie-w-bloku-mieszkalnym,do-odswiezenia/24886058.html) sell at hundreds of thousands. It's hard to justify having kids when you can't afford your own roof over your head.   

If you and your child get sick, you either wait [YEARS to visit the doctor](http://www.korektorzdrowia.pl/en/news/4-year-queue-see-a-specialist/) or you spend half your salary on private treatment. It's even worse when it comes to [mental help](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/05/01/stigmatisation-and-medication-polands-outdated-approach-to-mental-health/). Or you could just die, who cares xD. 

You can't find a good job. Either you work in a Januszex where labor laws aren't respected, overtime is unpaid and you often work without a contract of employment or you work under a junk contract. Or you overwork yourself to death in a corpo.    

Public transportation is shitty and pretty much nonexistent outside major cities. Wanna have kids in the country? Too bad, buy a car or get crammed into private busses older than your parents or just move to a city lol. [Bus lines are disappearing](https://ibb.co/XFcqBgV), just like [train lines](https://ibb.co/TLgT683).

If you want your child to go to nursery and kindergarten, then wait 300 places in line, or spend even more on private nursery. 

If you want your child to be educated, too bad. He'll have to memorize shittons of unnecessary stuff and be bullied by teachers and students, when he reports that he'll be blamed too. Stress, depression, burnout and so on guaranteed. It's even worse when you go to college.          

If your fetus has some complications that threaten its and even your life, too bad. I hope you have a couple kilos for a trip to Slovakia or Czechia (but you probably don't).           

And climate change, ecosystem collapse, capitalism and new technologies like AI and biotech. They all make future look grim and hopeless.

Parents are also exhausted by societal expectations. Women are expected to be independent and work, while still taking care of the kids. Fathers share housework and childcare more equally, but are still expected to mostly work and be the family's main income.  

Why is this a problem?   

#Because our modern elderly pension funds and socioeconomic systems rely on working adults being the majority. If they don't, the system dies. 

They require constant population growth or at least staying the same. If you can't have that, you need a demographic peak once a few generations.    

More old people means skyrocketing healthcare and elder care costs. Working adults would have to work even more for less. The financial burden would be insane. 

Those older people would also elect people who favor them and wealth over climate change mitigation, cost of living crisis mitigation and other leftist policies.    

We need massive public housing programs, free and universal childcare, healthcare, education and transportation as well as financial incentives for parents and better wages and 4 hour work days and 4 day work weeks. Not [800+](https://tvn24.pl/tvn24-news-in-english/poland-approves-child-benefit-hike-as-election-looms-st7282516) for every child, but real incentives. ",1294,673,0.63,GenZ,8,Tuesday,Evening

 basically, we are in second year of uni and only met this year, through one of my housemates. we have become really close and he practically lives at my house, as he is friends with all of my housemates as well. we basically just have become super close, and i realised i think i like him as more than a friend recently. however, i dont want to ruin our friendship and dont know how he feels so have not said anything to practically anyone about my feelings. since we are so close, we are each other's number one best friends on snapchat, (very juvenile i know but we have the red heart), text all the time, hangout one on one and do couple like stuff all the time. recently we got quite drunk at a friends house and he got into bed with me and fell asleep spooning me. however a friend of mine said she asked him and he said he would never be more than friends with me. but his actions just sometimes contradict this, e.g. very touchy with me, i always catch him looking at me and smiling even in group settings, and there just is that vibe. a lot of people also notice this and comment but we both havent addressed it to each other. he also talks to me about girls, and i do the same about guys. anyways i guess im wondering is it normal for guys to behave this way around girls they genuinely have no interest in beyond normal friendship, or do u think he could have feelings for me?? also a year before we even met and became friends we realised we matched on hinge and talked for a bit not sure thats relevant but hahah. however i know im not his 'type', im tall, blonde, he is into short brunettes. theres more stuff i could go into detail about but this is just a rambly summary.

also, ive never had a super close 'platonic' relationship with a guy before so maybe im just overthinking what actually is just normal friendly behaviour.

i feel like at our age there is so much nuance around guy/girl friendships esp with texting/social media. is it possible to even have a complete platonic guy/girl friendship???",5,3,1.0,GenZ,7,Wednesday,Evening

1c6asga,2024-04-17 14:06:52,Why does this happen?,"So i apologize if these kids are outside of of GenZ but it was the closet age group  that could maybe explain it to me . I am not trying to disparage or insult, or lump every young adult in the same group. 

Someone showed me yesterday a short clip on X of a high school student slapping a female teacher twice.  
To my horror he kept scrolling and it was one after another of high school males assaulting teachers. 
If it wasn’t a teacher it was a high school male punching or slapping a female student.  There is no need to provide examples of it, I’m pretty sure everyone has seen what I’ve seen- and I really don’t want to see them again. So..

When did this start happening? Why does this happen ? Why do these kids think this is ok?  And most importantly what is to blame for this behavior?  My wife who works with special needs kids so she is somewhat connected to today’s teens thinks that because of smart phones.  She says kids  are losing the ability to “use their words”. She said they act impulsively and don’t understand how to diffuse situations with words. They speak to  people with the same sarcastic manner as you normally see online except in person there usually are consequences. Mike Tyson also spoke of this. 

I am calling BS on that. I blame my generation of parenting.  My mom would have beaten the holy shyt out of me for raising a hand to a teacher or female student and then my dad would have had a turn.  Knowing that would be in my future kept me from acting like that.  Instead of that my generation of parents gives out participation trophy’s , put helmets & knee pads & elbow pads on kids to ride a bike, and blame everyone else if their kids is an entitled POS. Again, I blame my generation of parents and lawmakers.  Sadly that type of parenting is frowned upon now. 

The third opinion I heard is social media.  Basically “monkey see -monkey do”. 

So what is the biggest contributing factor to this behavior.  And please understand that I know this is a small percentage of teens that engage in this behavior and it certainly isn’t an attack on your generation, and  maybe I am still in shock from what I saw……. but holy shyt wtf is going on?

False. Malnutrition doesn't make you strong. Being bullied doesn't make you strong - it makes you traumatized - it puts you at risk of becoming irrational and growing up to be the next bully. Overcoming this requires an environment that's safe enough for you to self-reflect without interruption from haters that call you a pussy for re-gaining your empathy.

Strength doesn't come from being forced into relentless repetitive hardship.

Strength comes from freely choosing new challenges and pursuing them with plenty of rest & nutrition along the way.

this annoys me and i cant fully put my finger on it, i think its because we're being labelled as a problem in the workforce, instead of the workforce being a problem

also it's massively polarising and generalised, yet I do also identify with this ""problematic"" being they're referring to, just not with the negative phrasing they're using

*"" Zoomers are perceived to have a work ethic that’s considerably lower than previous generations and are labeled difficult to work with.""\**

*"" So, what can modern organizations do to get ahead of the compound challenges of retaining, engaging, and motivating a generation that, according to the data, is disloyal, disengaged, and lacking motivation? ""*

WHY AM I STILL READING THIS

1c4t8x2,2024-04-15 18:16:20,Of course gen z is angry ,"Yes i am RANTING because I get really tired of older generations, especially baby boomers, talking about how gen z has it good but we are too lazy to do anything and all we do is whine about working.

When will boomers admit that their policies that they put in place, did nothing but benifit themselves and now they are sucking the life out of the economy (aside from usual inflation) because they strained the capacity of public education, postsecondary education, the labor market, and the housing market. Today, they are the largest cohort in the labor force. As Boomers exit the workforce, they will strain the Social Security system. They were greedy with the economy and got the upper hand on all generations after. 

OF COURSE GEN Z IS ANGRY. We get told we are lazy and failures but you can't live off off anything less than 13$ in a small town and nothing under 18$ an hour in major cities (without children!). Someone told me the other day ""well I worked minimum wage and was able to support my family, you just need to be willing to make sacrifices"" THATS NOT EVEN POSSIBLE NOW. Getting an education puts you thousands in debt  if you decide to go any university. The average age of moving out of parent house is now 25-28. And there are not enough children being born to replace the previous generation because you can't even afford to take care of yourself anymore. But while boomers sit in their house they bought for 100-150k, they tell gen z they are failures for not buying a 300k house at 18 years old. So many people are on unemployment and have been actively applying for jobs for several months but never gets a call back. Everyone I know and myself tries so hard to just live paycheck to paycheck and it's SAD. Gen Z may be rude and angry, but boomers are greedy and judgemental.

1c6mrsw,2024-04-17 22:10:12,Dating Culture WTF,"I was scrolling through my feed today and there was a reddit post about if nobody asks each other out anymore and I wanted to give some thoughts for discussion. 

I am a 31 year old pansexual millennial and I was not able to date at all because of religious parents restricting bodily autonomy and privacy due to purity culture and stagnant wages and high cost of living. Then I lived through #metoo which created and compounded the weird culture of concealment around dating and Sexuality where everybody seemed to be paranoid and on edge that any person might be ""creepy"" or ""needy"" or ""desperate"" or a harasser or secretly a rapist or something, which basically just caused me to self sabotage and have panic attacks avoiding dating at all because I wasn't able to support a long term relationship anyways. 

So anyways I was reading this subreddit post on this topic and people are asking why young people aren't asking each other out anymore and it looks like the Gen z guys are saying they are too afraid to for the same reasons and the Gen z girls are saying older guys hitting on them is still creepy or annoying because it feels like ""their dad"" is hitting on them. 

So... let me get this straight. When you are young and can't afford to support a long term relationship, that's not going to work and you are controlled by purity culture and nobody wants to settle down because they see marriage as oppressive. But then once you can afford a long term relationship then it becomes ""creepy"" and a #metoo violation because you are like ""their dad"" (wtf as a millennial if I'm like the dad of anybody in Gen z that means I would have had to have had a kid at like 10 years old).

What is going on with you guys for real 

I think as a millennial of 31 I lived through both purity culture and the #metoo movement which basically created a cultural paranoia and culture of Concealment around dating which benefits the most dishonest rapey people while leaving people who are trying to take things seriously kind of screwed over having panic attacks to not be seen as a harasser or whatever for hitting on women. This was a concern especially in the Workplace where women would be complaining about Workplace Harassment. But usually what I'm seeing is most people spend most of their adult lives in the Workplace with physical third places becoming rarer and rarer (especially ones that don't cost alot of money). So realistically wtf are you supposed to do exactly? Get a therapist? Get a dog? Go on dating apps? Lol riiighht

So now I'm single and 31 and definitely just stopped caring what age gaps there are as long as there is consent 

Another thing I've found is that as a guy using Hinge or Tinder or Bumble has been a total disaster but if I use grindr I get a ton of people initiating Conversations with me and wanting to actually go out, have long conversations that don't just end up with ghosting, and hook up with the potential for longer term connection - even with women. Why is it easier to date as a lgbtq person than as a cis guy? Another thing is that women and guys with age gaps seem to not really care on grindr while on the conventional apps people seem to be extremely paranoid

In my opinion if women don't like age gaps and think it's creepy they are going to need to start express true gender equality by taking the lead and initiating sometimes both in person and in the bedroom otherwise to find somebody that meets their expectations (good job, extremely confident with no fks given attitude, is experienced enough how to navigate this late stage capitalist hellscape, can entertain them and take them out, is good in bed, has a power disparity to easily lead them, and so on) is going to be older by default. I had one experience with a girl who was 28 on Bumble and the minute I started talking about feelings it seemed like she was turned off and like 80% of the women on these apps wants to be led and has a sub fetish and won't be bothered to be with guys who want a more equal arrangement in the bedroom and in person

Anyways I got left behind so anybody who thinks I'm creepy for trying now I really just don't care after all the purity culture and #metoo stuff. I care about consent and respect but if you think I'm not going to try to hit on you and shoot my shot because you are younger sorry but not sorry I definitely am no regrets

EDIT: Also I cannot figure out why women my own age want me to Lead them and initiate and do everything. If they are equal outside of the bedroom I expect the dynamic in the bedroom to be the same, otherwise if they want somebody with that power dynamic they crave there is going to be an Age Gap. They always act bewildered by older guys are hitting on them and they have more Sexual chemistry with older guys but less emotional chemistry. I'm not going to be playing that game, if they want gender equality they can also extend that in the dating sphere and the bedroom. Otherwise there is going to be an Age Gap. If they think it's creepy that older guys are hitting on them I think they should not be looking for dominant guys to take control, they need to be more equal and that includes in taking initiative, making the money, and the Sexual compatibility. As a pansexual person there is NO REASON that dating and hooking up with other guys or Trans people should be 10000% easier. There is literally no excuse. Do you think power dynamics are sexy that usually come with age gaps or are creepy? Is it oppressive for the guy to be leading and controlling things or is it oppressive? Do you want equality or does it annoy you that the guy isn't in charge? Make up your freaking minds and get it together people",15,0,0.35,GenZ,3,Wednesday,Night
1c54swz,2024-04-16 02:20:49,When we get called lazy for not wanting to suffer for 18 years and 9 months,"Just want to begin by saying I'm not a parent myself, but I was 15 when the oldest of my younger siblings was born so I do know a lot about taking care of kids and how complicated it can be. 

When I was a kid up to when I started living in an appartment at 20, I really wanted kids, but honestly I just don't think it's a realistic goal to have a happy life with kids if you don't make a combined salary of at least 150-200K in your household or if you really really think you'll find pleasure in the simple things of parenthood as a gen z. 

Unless you have not been exposed to social media (which is extremely rare nowadays), expectations of raising kids have increased to the max. I'm not saying some new safety measures and parenting styles aren't a good change, but we're also talking about the picture perfect families sharing everything on social media, the fact that babies have like actual big brand clothes now for some reason, the morman mom's cooking everything from scratch on tiktok - including oreos... ew - to showcase how bad you are personnally handling your life as a mom - everything to make parents feal more and more incapable in their role. 

When I look at my older sister, I can see she tries so hard to give her child all the activities she sees on social media and all so she can get relief for a second of not thinking she's a horrible parent for needing a break from time to time - she's also a single mom, so double the work. 

I get annoyed when people call gen z lazy for not wanting to have kids, but like what do you want us to do? I have an ok salary rn, enough to give me an ok place and take care of a cat, but add a kid to that and boom, now on top of the 40 hours I'm doing for not much, you're telling me I'm going to struggle like never before and not be able to get any time for myself? Oh and also wreck my body for years. Why would anyone want that! Unless you're rich enough to be able to either have one parent stay at home or have a babysitter/cleaning person help with household chores, I just don't see how you'll be able to enjoy much of the joys of parenthood. 

Edit: I just shared one aspect of it. This is conversations I've had with friends and wanted to see if other people my age related to. The reasons stated here are not the only reasons I wouldn't want a child and I don't feel like I have to keep repeating myself on it lol. Find me immature if you want for explaining the economy is bad which makes it harder to have kids... Start reading up on the costs of having a child and you might get where I'm getting at haha

Edit 2: idc about social media myself I'm talking about parent's experience I've heard about. It seems to be an added struggle that is particular to our generation. If you're not a millenial or gen z it might be harder to relate to as you did not grow up with that and that's ok. You may not have friends who struggle with that and that's great. Also, if it bothers you so much I'll change ""suffer"" to struggle lol english is not my first language and it describes better what I meant in this post. ",370,601,0.83,GenZ,16,Tuesday,Night

Turn to each other for advice or when we need to tell someone something we can't discuss with anyone else. We inspire each other to grow in life and we hit the gym everyday. I see only good things in our futures. I was always better at making good decisions and bro was always better at getting girls. We are able to look up to each other in different aspects in life. All our younger friends look up to us. It's good that we can set a positive roll model for others. 

Me and bro definitely not gay. My older brother (1 year older) and his friends always joked about us being gay because how close we were and always hanging out. In my heart I felt that they were jealous because we would push each other to be better, and my older brother would stay stagnant in life, staying in the house, chilling and smoking with his friends, not pushing each other to hit the gym or get money or find better girlfriends. 
But me and bro continued with our mindset. Years later we are in the best positions we've ever been in. and I feel like is because we've always had each others backs. There's been many times in our friendship that situations came up where me and bro would disagree on things but we would still have each others backs. Iron sharpens Iron. Finding a friendship like this doesn't happen all the time. Sacrifices must be made to have something like this. Always tell each other the truth. Say what's on your mind. If you disagree say it, don't hold back your feelings to spare theirs.
 I still love my older brother but often I find my self not being able to tell him how I feel about the things he does to spare his feeling. So I just let him keep doing what he does. I allow him to be complacent and comfortable in the way he lives. My Older brother used to be my best friend, I used to look up to him. But once we reached upperclass men we began to grow apart.
Many people say Blood is thicker than Water. But Mud is thicker than Blood. And me and bro been through the mud together. Shedded blood, sweat, and tears. 
If there's a lesson I could sum up from my post it would be this. ""You are a reflection of the 5 people who hang around the most."" So make sure you keep positive role models in your circle. So you can push each other to grow.

And I know the individual contribution to global carbon emissions are not that big. But if those who are able to afford sustainable ways of living collectively don't give a shit, they're as much at fault as corporations discarding climate policies for their own financial gain. The fact that we're trapped in an economic system which not only doesn't seem to know the limits of growth, but also indirectly forces those companies to act the way they act isn't helping either. 

Finding a solution for all of this is pretty hard. But I like to start by trying to develop some kind of conscientiousness to at least reflect upon individual behavior.

1c5v8yr,2024-04-16 23:49:53,I don't think I even want friends at this point,"I don't think I even want friends at this point

For my whole life I've struggled to make friends and maintain friendships. If things are looking good my brain will create a problem and make me want to push myself away from them in order to ""avoid hurt"" as a lot of people grow tired of me since I'm quite a replaceable person.

At this point I don't think I even want friends. My social battery is broken.I can't speak with my parents about very simple things without getting extremely angry and upset and having to leave and I can't have friends because the social responsibility of meeting someone regularly and communicating with them regularly is such a pain. Even if I like a person I always get too burnt out to speak to them and end up pushing them away. If this tiredness and irritation is what having friends is I do not want them. I had 2 friends before I took a break out of school and I've made a conscious effort to push them both away.

I'm literally depressed, a friendless antisocial NEET and all at 17.

What the fuck do I do? I really need to get out of this. I know a part of me wants to contribute to society and make friends but I just can't bring myself to.  I don't think i care about anything other than reading online stories. I'm due to return to sixth form and do a creative course and normally I'd be excited about that but now I'm too depressed to even draw anything new for my porfolio. I've torn up a lot of my sketchbooks.

I got my Canes and on my way back I was stopped a traffic light. Lo & behold, I got rear-headed by some drunk guy in his 50s. Mind you, this isn’t even my car; it’s my brother’s. 

That guy came out, and we exchanged insurance info & shit. Now I’m freaking the fuck out because I don’t want my parents to find out that I got into a crash. My brother is at college right now and I dunno how he’ll react when he comes back in June.

Is there a way I can resolve this without my parents or law enforcement getting involved?

1c61xli,2024-04-17 05:28:35,She wants to marry me???!!!,"My girlfriend wants me to marry her???!!!

So yeah. To give you some context we had broken up before in October after dating since January. The details of the fight are not important but it was because I felt neglected by lack of attention (we have a ldr) and she was being really toxic. 

So we really didn’t talk until February. She apologized and said she didn’t want to date and just wanted to be friends (which I was totally happy with).

So we talked and eventually some how she ends up saying she loves me BUT insists that we are just friends. So we end up saying we love each other often. I thought this was a bit weird but it’s fine and she’s quirky so it’s okay.

But eventually she says things like she misses me and we fall asleep on the phone together and end up close again doing normal couple things like saying good night and confiding in each other sleeping on the phone. Whilst I’m never %100 sure what we are. Until last weekend…

So basically she started talking about some nsfw things and we kinda flirted. Then she introduced me to studio Ghibli (I TOTALLY RECOMMEND BTW) and she picks some songs for me to listen to and asks if I like them. I loved all of them and this one song in particular. After me telling her she was like “ YOU GOTTA MARRY ME NOW” I respond with shock emojis she says “MARRY MEEEE”

I’m in shock and think she’s joking and say yes. IT WASNT UNTIL 2 DAYS LATER I ask and find out she’s DEAD SERIOUS. 

WHAT DO I DO? This seams like a bad idea I love her to bits but I’m only 16..

Edit: She doesn’t want to like tomorrow but she wants me to promise that we will

I’m not sure if I took any of it seriously .
I hope I was there in the moment
I’m not sure I did all I could
I don’t remember it clearly, I’ve had so much Brain fog . And was the girl that lived in her headphones non stop music to numb everything . 

I’m really feeling the anxiety of time spent that can’t be returned and guilty about it .

I’m not ready to let go and be old . I don’t feel like I’ve lived enough. I forgot we were on a ticking timeline. 

I feel scared. Because I ruined something I can’t take back.

Picking up the pieces from here. Mentally I’m so young , it’s gross.

I’ve watched others for so long I forgot I was here.
I let people just use me, with no regard for how I felt .

I was an empty shell for so long and all of a sudden my soul returned and I’m wondering all of a sudden how the years passed like that.
I was a shell for 10 years and it’s really scary waking up feeling like it was all a nightmare but this is my life . I woke up older . It happened . 

I’ve never been to prom, I don’t have friends .


I’m wondering if I have the right to chase my teenage fantasy’s in my 20s like ice skating , because of this running out of time existential crisis. I never got the chance in my younger years to be apart of anything as much as I had wished because of my family situation. Then I was assaulted and after that I put myself in the night club scene because I didn’t know what to do, I was so disillusioned I lost all sense of time and space . All my senses were stripped. My sense of myself. 

I’m scared to go to sleep now because it’s another day off of my life.

I just realized that this current moment is all I’ve ever had and I never understood that, I used to wonder why everything took so long 😭😭😭
Why am I like this. Plz tell me. ,am I the only foolish one that is stunted and broken, and didn’t realize that I’m responsible for building this life around me? That life isn’t happening to me , I was supposed to be the one experiencing it ",13,13,0.77,GenZ,15,Tuesday,Night

Panda Express- Makes me sick all the time. In fact i just got done puking it up. Last time i'm having panda. It USED to be good at a affordable price. But even the most basic thing (Orange chicken) just tastes like crap. Like how tf do you mess up on your signature item that is mass produced. You literally just have to cook the chicken and put in the package sauce and salt. Even the chow mien sucks.

Chipotle- Is expensive for what you get. Though i will be honest, on RARE occasions, i will justify the cost and eat there because the food is still pretty good

McDonald's- Overpriced mess. I would usually get a couple hot n' spicy chicken sandwiches. for 3 dollars. But now they aren't worth it. for 2 now, it's going to be over 6 dollars. It's just not worth it

Wendy's- Not worth it anymore either. Just really highly priced food for no reason. The food is good. But will never be able to justify it's price. Especially since the food is small af.

Subway- over 12 dollars for a freaking basic footlong. I'm sorry but no basic footlong is worth over 12 dollars. I can make a sub at home for far less. The only thing they are good at is their bread, that's it

KFC- Just overrated, overpriced greasy food

The only good fast food place that is actually decent is taco bell. I usually get a couple of rice and bean and cheese burritos. With the chipotle sauce. And now with good avocado sauce they have. It's just slightly over 4 dollars. But it is actually worth it. I usually get cinnamon twists and a medium drink. So it's around 7 usd for me.

Meanwhile, the biggest bully in my elementary school who hit both boys and girls for fun and for gain had a mom who was known to be extremely hands off in her parenting style.

On more than one occasion, she was asked if she ever spanked her child as punishment for hitting others, and she made it vehemently clear that she did not believe in corporal punishment whatsoever.

Is there a reason for this discrepancy in the schools of thought among gen-z, regarding why physicality works against bullies when it comes from peers but not from parents?

1c51oy6,2024-04-15 23:56:31,Are human beings happier in an agrarian lifestyle?,"One of the biggest things about modern society is the loneliness epidemic and the lack of community that people are experiencing. Suicide is very common in developed nations and politics are very fragmented. I spent a lot of time musing on why loneliness, suicide, depression and substance abuse are growing problems and seem to be getting worse each year and only really seems to be a thing in developed nations and then it hit me: technology/national development. The more developed a country becomes the more depressed the society becomes. What you lack in comfort you gain in community, what you lose through community you gain through comfort.

A lot of people blame multiculturalism/ immigration/ ""wokeism"" for all their woes, but look at Japan and South Korea. Both developed, first-world economies and technological titans exceeding far past America. They are both nearly completely ethnically and culturally homogeneous in every way and both nations certainly aren't ""woke"". However, suicide rates are sky-high in both countries. Japan has so many suicides they have a forest famous just for the sheer number of deaths in it. Not to mention the population decline in Japan. Hikokimori, NEET, Laying Down movement are all eastern concepts that are growing in popularity in the west. Not to mention, look at the most popular genre of Japanese manga/anime: isekai. In nearly every isekai, a depressed 25-45 year old average guy hates his life and gains happiness by dying and getting reborn in a medieval agrarian society.

Look at cults, isn't it a coincidence all the common victims of them tend to be wealthy, privileged people who sell their belongings to live in a secluded agrarian commune? Look at the Amish, they don't tend to have as much depression, suicide or general malaise as world around them does. Even Africa tribes don't suffer from depression or suicide at nearly the same rates. To the Hadza tribe of East Africa suicide is unheard of, depression is unheard of. Why does it seem to be the poorest, more agrarian societies that seem to be the happiest, the most jolliest people and seem to have an overabundance of children being born? Meanwhile in developed nation, populations are declining yet depression, suicide and loneliness seems to be rising? It has to be the technology and overall development which is the cause.",21,9,0.77,GenZ,8,Monday,Night

30 years old millenial here. I didnt always have access to the internet, i remember playing mario on my NES on the tv, that was the best i could do to kill time while my parents argued behind my back.

But even at that time, it was just extremely addictive, but its something i didnt always have access to and i didnt have an infinite amount of games or videos to play.

I was 10 when i first got access to internet.

I wonder, when you are growing up with a tablet watching tik tok on multiple screens... How do you even start curbing that addiction?

As in my head its the hardest addiction to beat, technology that was made to be as entertaining as possible to keep attention and engagement, especially when you are born and getting exposed to it right away.

I am 100 percent sure its way harder for people who grew up like that to beat tech addiction, gaming etc. / create healthy boundaries then drug / substance addiction.

I don't always make the best choices but I feed myself, exercise, and have decent hygiene. I have a few good friends and a few close family members. I count myself lucky and compared to how I used to be I think I am doing well, but sometimes I just cannot shake this fear of the road ahead of us, even when I disconnect from my phone and even considering the many cool things I have gotten to experience. I know I am not the only one and I do not think these are entirely individual problems.

Regardless of your political, social, and spiritual affiliations, I think we can all agree these are somewhat trying times to live through, or at the very least, things do not appear to be getting easier into the future. I do genuinely think that we will get through it all, or at the very least, our descendants will eventually know a world of peace and relative prosperity. But we still have to get through the present, what with war and disease and climate change, and just live our lives the best we can as individuals and as communities.

I like to go on runs and listen to music or play musical instruments when I can. I usually cut loose with friends once every week or two. I try to remind myself that taking care of myself will boost my self worth and that everyone feels sad and anxious from time to time. But I want to do better with some of my vices and dark thoughts and I want to hear how some of you manage your day to day lives.

How are you doing? What do you do to take your mind off of things? What do you want to start doing? What do you want to stop doing? What do you need help with, and what do you need to talk about? It may be a bit cliche but it is true that you are all loved and appreciated.",2,3,1.0,GenZ,16,Tuesday,Night

After work, I read this bro's post and it struck a chord. I've experienced what he's feeling, and certainly felt anger, helplessness and despair. But after studying and thinking about it, I've come up with some ideas of my own about some things I'd like to discuss with you here. If you think there is any improvement in my thinking or anything else you would like to say, please let me know and together we can improve and progress.

_____________________________________________

Here is my response to this post:

To be brutally honest, we can certainly complain about some people enjoying the policy dividends of the times or some other things, but the essence of the matter does not lie in the effort or otherwise. Bro, even on the road to success, ""hard work"" is the most basic but also the least important quality. 

Don't easily categorize success with age. There are bums who are old and there are spendthrifts who are young. What is the point? It's CLASS!  Admit it, even if you work hard, there are rich people who can take your wealth without even realizing it. The paycheck you work so hard for is only enough to barely keep you afloat. That's the brutal truth about class that hides behind the generations.

Batman's superpower is ""I'm rich."" Why? Because the entire city of Gotham is owned by Wayne Enterprises, and the wages he pays to the citizens eventually trickle back to him by way of purchases, earning him everyone's labor output in the process. And we as citizens have to listen to people like this preach ""you're lazy and unmotivated and that's why you're not successful""?

Hey bro, congrats on getting ANGRY because you're aggrieved that you're not getting what you deserve for all your hard work because you're finding out about the lies that have been fed to you by the elite and the uninformed. The so-called elites through media, advertisements, and all sorts of means have created a dream for you to become a human being. You suffer because you WAKE UP and have to put yourself back to sleep in order to adapt to the world.
What we need is not to sleep, but to change the world again. 

Gen Z has the ability and the power to do this, and we are destined to be the masters of the world of the future. It's time to make a change, to learn the original logic of how the world works, to change ourselves, to change the world.",11,2,0.63,GenZ,8,Tuesday,Night

1c5awqu,2024-04-16 08:22:32,USdefaultism and r/GenZ,"Recently this sub seems to centre more on the US in favour of an international point of view. I’m kind of sad that this is happening, because it excludes the remaining 96% of the world population, or 57% of reddit user activity. Generations are certainly not limited to a specific country on the American continent, and the factors that unite and define Gen Z such as relatable internet memes and apathy at the current economic situation (why houses this expensive!) do bridge across the continents.

And, as we were all\* taught, excluding other kids is no fun.

That does not mean that people can’t talk about the USA if they want to. It would however be very helpful if you wouldn’t refer to the USA as ‘this country’ or ‘our country’, or in general forget that the rest of the world, you know, exists.

**What is defaultism? And US-defaultism?**

Defaultism in general refers to the act of assuming that something is the case without it being explicitly introduced. US-defaultism refers to people assuming that whatever happens, happens in the US, and whoever you speak to online also lives in the US. Instances of this are forgetting that other time zones exist, that the US constitution is not universal, and correcting someone’s British English. If you need another example, the r/USdefaultism community has you covered. 

**But isn’t Reddit an American site?**

Yes, Reddit corporate is based in the USA. No, it isn’t an American (USA) site, because its top-level domain is .com (commercial) and not .us (united states of america). This makes it an international website, which can be seen in the various communities which don’t speak English at all. Nor are Americans (USA) the majority of the users, but the plurality, meaning that if you were to receive a random user odds are they aren’t American.

**The numbers.**

Roughly how dominant are people from the USA on Reddit? It depends how you measure this. If we look at total activity, which ignores dead accounts, we find that 42.95% of the activity is generated by people from the USA. (source below) Adding together the percentages found in that table for every European country results in a total of 35.19% of the total activity being generated by Europe.

But what about the members of r/GenZ? Well, according to this poll (reddit link below) there’s about three people from the USA for every two Europeans, though this will be old by the time I post it.

Ty for reading my little rant.

**TLDR;**

Don't ignore us pls

1c4qf8s,2024-04-15 16:24:00,Posting platforms are horrible,"By this I'm talking about Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, anything where people post about their lives constantly. I got rid of Instagram and Snapchat (the only 2 things I've ever had) because I found myself constantly checking to see what anyone I knew was doing at anytime of the day. I pay for a phone bill, if I was actually interested in what one of my friends was doing, or wanted to vent to someone I trusted, why not just call or text them? A concerning amount of people are so obsessed to let insane amounts of people (most of which they may not even be that close with) know how their life is going. All those people who are doing really poorly and make a pathetic display of themselves online for some semblance of sympathy or attention anywhere they can get it. People who are doing really well showing off to get praise they havent been recieving. This isn't anything new, but it has definitely gotten much worse. I can genuinely say getting rid of those platforms has really helped my mental state a ton. I'm not constantly worried about being left out, missing something, or not knowing about something. Take this with a grain of salt, but if you genuinely have real friends, they will listen to you talk about your problems. If you're a genuinely real friend, your friends should feel comfortable to talk to you about their problems. When people post about these things online, I feel like it just gives up a very personal and intimate part of what makes relationships, romantic or not, work in real life. When you post something, you normally think about the people who are going to see it. Do you ever get genuinely upset, when the person you want to see it does, and doesn't like your post? Doesn't slide up on your story? Likes it but doesn't say anything? What the fuck is the point. You cannot start to feel better regarding anything without first starting to focus on yourself.  I'm sure many people in this generation have got to have some sort of problem with this. Am I crazy?

TL;DR
People are way too obsessed with posting about their lives and entire mental state/trauma online, and it's my opinion that people would be much better off mentally not being subjected to media that harms them rather than helps them.",11,16,0.82,GenZ,4,Monday,Afternoon

Wake up =immediately check phone ( connect to other people’s thoughts/opinions/problems/life updates etc)

Likely listen to music/radio etc while getting ready or commuting to work. (News,doom and gloom/some tragedy that happened far as fuck that does you no good to know about…or even subliminal from songs/advertisements etc)

Work for 8 hours (now you’re someone else for 8 hours bec you are at work and conforming to that culture or customer service standard)

Commute again(same thing as on the way to work..radio/ads/news etc)

Socialize (most people still  hide things about their true personality  from their friends as well..OR you’re smoking/drinking which alters your own thoughts/state of mind etc)

Relax (usually television or YouTube..more programming/ads/other people’s lives/thoughts and opinions etc)

If you think about it…most of our thoughts aren’t even our own . We constantly are getting pounded with input from outside influences or distractions..and by the time we look up..we have spent most of our lives with someone else having more of our attention than we give ourselves

I think that’s why a lot of people are depressed. Or they drink/smoke or even binge certain shit.because our own mind is an uncomfortable place because there is something about our life we need to fix.or maybe that’s just me lol",14,21,0.78,GenZ,15,Monday,Morning

she's very religious too. the thing a lot of people call abuse is when i was around 12 or 13 my school caught me cutting myself so i was given a referral to a mental health place. i spoke to the lady there for one session and she said she suspected i had autism but my mother didn't want me diagnosed with anything so she completely pulled me from that help program and instructed me to pray and sleep with a bible under my pillow after sorta yelling at me. I know that sounds a bit bad but she's from a very religious culture which is nothing like the UK so her intent isn't to abuse me. she's just a bit difficult but aren't everyone's parents? just because she's not my best friend doesn't mean she's abusing me. she's just a bit different. It's just her way of looking out for me.

To be honest If she is abusing me, I don't think I care a great deal, that's why it's not really that bad. I'm still not that good mentally and am probably going to commit next year to be honest, but that's more due to my own problems.",41,3,0.64,GenZ,7,Monday,Afternoon

I got every question about road laws, road signs and driving rules correct, but got wrong each question that included specific suspensions/consequences for breaking certain laws. In all of my study guides, none of these questions were covered.

For example, this is one of the questions that really tripped me up:
         “If a person over the age of 21 is caught buying alcohol for an underaged junior operator, which of the following happens?” 
A) 3 month license suspension and $200 fine
B) 6 month license suspension and $400 fine
C) 9 month license suspension and $600 fine
D) 12 month license suspension and $800 fine

After failing the first time I was very sad and bummed out so I gave up for a while, but im ready to try again. The only problem is im not sure how I can prepare for questions like these, seeing as the test questions are randomized and there are so many laws.

1c45o83,2024-04-14 22:05:56,"The decline in 3rd places and the rise of social media is only part of the story as to why many young people are hanging out less, have fewer close friends nowadays.","Hello everyone. 

So as the title says, theres been a lot of discussion lately about the decline in 3rd spaces as to the reasons why many young people nowadays have few close friends, are hanging out less etc. I would like to give a new perspective on it. 

I think there has been little attention given to the plite of people with disabilities. for my case for instance, i have been fully blind since i was 4 and a half months old, but i have tried to make the best of the situation given my circumstances. 

i am also not from the US, but i live in another anglophone country and i have traveled a good bit with my parents, and this seems to be a major issue in many anglophone countries. 

for example. i went to university, and out of a population of 15,000 students, at the time when i was in college I was the only blind person at that university. if there were other blind people there we didn’t hear about them and my parents never saw any other blind people there throughout my studies. even if there were other blind students on campus, the campus was like a literal maize. the main building was nearly impossible to get around without sighted help, most of the elevators had no braille in them, and it was a constant fight for academic supports throughout my 6 years of undergrad and post grad study. 

i got involved in clubs and societies on campus. However my experience with friendships in my courses was not a great experience. there was a lot of the time, a very ignorant almost ableist attitude towards people with disabilities from many of the people in my course. you’d be better off sticking with other disabled people for friendships were common statements that came my way when it came to a lot of college mates. 

While I did make some friends with some people in my course, most college mates went home most weekends and rarely ever hung out outside of lectures. Many had no hobbies outside of drinking and getting drunk in bars, and while I was never really into that scene because I don’t drink and just found a lot of nightclubs to be too noisy environments , I was more than willing to hangout with them in different places, Unfortunately, most weren’t interested, so I ended up making friends with mostly exchange students. 

Most of the clubs and society groups went home most weekends too. Despite that, I still got out and still do get out regularly with my parents and I have tried various activities, including swimming, bowling, rock climbing, skiing and even skateboarding. I even tried surfing too! 

While many have rightly stated that the advent of social media and smart phones might be a contributing factor to less people hanging out and going outside etc, the reality is that social media existed long before the pandemic and the internet has actually been a lifeline for people like myself. Music production has been a huge part of my life, and apart from a dj society I was part of at university it was difficult to find people with similar interests nearby. 

Things have really changed here since covid though. There’s no cafe or restaurant scene after 6 pm and most independent coffee shops are closed around here after 3 or 4 pm. There is nothing to do in the city at night nowadays apart from eat and drink in pubs. 

Also, the city has become quite unsafe at night recently, a lot more people begging on the streets and people looking for money on a regular basis from passers by and all sorts of things which is really sad to see. 

If things were not so expensive at the moment and the city not so unsafe at night I would love to see much more of a late evening cafe culture here like they have in much of continental Europe. Even though the interest might be there for it I am not sure how it would work in reality. At present the costs of running small businesses are through the roof , and there aren’t enough non drinkers to keep many cafes open passed 6 pm in the evenings. 

There are some other observations I have made as a blind person. Neighbours in the neighbourhood hardly salute each other on the streets now and hardly ever have get togethers. The city center is like a ghost town after 6 pm , and many of the local cafes, restaurants are an awful lot quieter than they use to be. There are 2 bookstores in my city, and they have become as quiet as a mouse over the last 2 years. ",2,7,1.0,GenZ,32,Sunday,Night

Everyone hates skibidy toilet but to me it’s the same as Ugandan knuckles. I’d say it’s like a way louder and more obnoxious version of the surreal memes phase we had, (remember meme man everyone? Orang, vegetal, t h e v o i d)

That said I also think it’s important that we as a group look for the positives and share valuable information with each other. There’s opportunities out there and ways to meet people. I say this as someone trying to figure out how to move forward and I think we can all take the time to focus on that and help each other especially given how hard it is to find that sometimes.

Video games:

>Bosh'tet = Asshole
>
>Vot = Shit (insult) 
>
>Esan = Young one 
>
>Corpo = Corporate 
>
>B'vehk = by Vivec. Translates to ""my god""
>
>Sera = Sir
>
>Preem = When Mr Bossman sells you 500g of the most premium quality pocket lint. 

Words I made myself: 
>Tinu = Cannabis
>
>Tindi = A joint of cannabis
>
>Seeha - A dolt/ditz
>
>Obese - fantastic e.g ""that gig was obese"". Can also mean excessive. 
>
>Wasp - an extremely unlikeable person. Most people hate wasps
>
>Alien = Basically somebody who acts like an alien trying to mimic human behaviour. Very similar to NPC energy. Just a soulless flanderisation of how people are expected to behave. Think of somebody stoned out of their mind trying to act natural.
>
>Hidden One = That friend who is somehow still friends with everyone but never shows up to anything. Heard but never seen. E.g ""Heard much from the hidden one?"" Title can only be given for 1 person in your circle 
>
>Scroller = A person addicted to screens
>
>Zombie = NPC. Somebody who does a 9-5 in a service or office job and has no ambition outside of settling down with a wife and kids. No ambition, no hobbies, nothing of interest. 
>
>Cleanout = Sifting through your phone to delete all those screenshots you never used, random reference photos you downloaded to add context to a conversation from months ago etc. Can also mean unfollowing/unfriending people you haven't talked to in years
>
>Ain = From the Arabic word for ""eye"". Means somebody has good foresight or are perceptive. E g you would just reply ""Ain"" when somebody shows to have keen foresight or planning.
>
>Nnhg = Think of that sound people make when their neck is touched. It's just a cue to say something has given you the ick",5,2,0.67,GenZ,23,Monday,Night

The reasoning why I’m saying it’s difficult is because I feel like religion, especially because mine is Protestant Christianity, is putting me in a tug a war. 

I’m a 20 year old African American women who believes in the “white man religion” 
But I’m also a gen z’er who has access to knowledge and history who doesn’t want to be ignorant. 

So I feel like I fight my generation cause say that the religious violence and trauma is from people weaponizing religion, not the actual religion itself; not God himself. 

But I fight the people who share my beliefs, because they treat the Bible like a history book, and science book, and it’s just not. Like the genocide happening rn, people are for the wrong side because they think they’re rooting for God’s people, but really they’re wrong, but too ignorant and lazy to read and realize.

It seems that, especially after the pandemic, a lot of people have expressed a disconnect from nature and desire to be close to it. I've seen a spike in off grid and outdoorsy/survival content online recently, as if a lot of people are feeling this way now.

I myself have felt isolated from nature for a long time; my goal is to relocate to the mountians in a few years and start up a small homestead, so I can actually spend my time outdoors and live in nature instead of treating it like a brief escape from my house. It's interesting how suddenly it seems like a lot of people also have similar desires. 

I think it speaks a lot about how modern life can deprive us of some of our most basic, human needs, like being outside and able to run, play and live under the sun instead of shingles and concrete.

 I know for one that never I find myself in that field, no matter how bad my day was or how depressed I feel, no matter all my worries, fears and troubles about the past and future of my life, I'm able to just unwind and enjoy the present; all the birds and bugs chittering around me, the wind weaving through the grasses, the feeling of the fresh dirt on my hands, it all just makes me feel, well, happy and at peace.

No one wants to be your friend if you're always fucking negative. The negative emotions *themselves* are killing you. It's physically unhealthy to be so upset all the time, but it is fixable. You need to become a person you like being around, that's what makes other people attracted to you. Your smiles will be forced, and you will be awkward. That's because you're not good at being happy or likeable yet. Just imagine in five years, you could have so many friends that when some other poor fuck comes up to you and awkwardly tries to force a friendship that you will feel the same way toward them: pity and discomfort.

It's sad to see young people go through it. I been through it, so I know how it is. What's even worse is to be 45 with 0 friends, 0 bitches (male or female), 0 interests outside drinking/smoking your problems away, and always talking about how unfair life is.

Get your skin clear. Take care of your oral hygiene. Look at clothes and decide what style you like. Find a band or comedian you love. Get *really* good at something. Exercise and eat the right amount of food to gain/lose weight. Go (back) to school for what you want to do. Learn how to deal with anxiety as a physical symptom.

Foster competence, not confidence. Don't tell yourself you should like yourself. Make yourself that motherfucking guy.

Become who you really are.

Edit: Seems to be some confusion about the 'poor fuck' comment. I'll assume my point wasn't clear and I needed to phrase it better. The point isn't to become apathetic to other people's suffering -- it's that when you're in it you feel like the weirdo. When you got your own thing going on, you see exactly why (even if you were that weirdo before) people don't want to be around thise types of people. When you got your own thing going on, other people can tell and like to be around those kinds of people. When you're so available that they're your only friend, it forces people into an awkward situation when you need that for your social interaction, and they genuinely are just tryna live their life. If you had a good life, you're not gonna dive headfirst into someone else's problems to solve them. People want other people who are like them, they don't want friends out of pity. Sorry for the confusion.

Second edit: For half yall commenting that you have already improved everything and still have no friends: this post was for you. You lack self-awareness. You're defensive, depressive, and not fun to be around. If you don't want to be told what your problem is, you're not gonna get better.

I’ve been in college and high school for the past 4 years because I’m in a program at the college that I go to that let’s you take high school and college classes at the same time for free there because they get money from the state since you are in high school technically. But that is besides the point I’m going into automotive engineering and all these classes are just draining the life out of me. Sometimes I feel like just not getting out of bed not going to school. Just one day with out worrying about when the next assignment is due or when is the next Calculus test and am I prepared. I just want to be an automotive engineer already.

Like why have I taken all of these classes and still know nothing about what I’m going into. I haven’t even taken an automotive class yet. Also after doing the same draining routine every day I go do something different and don’t enjoy it because well I could be using my time to get my work done instead and feel like I’m wasting time here and I should really do this work first. This is why I can’t be motivated to work out anymore I just can’t stop thinking about the time I’m wasting. Like I just want this constant feeling of dread and unhappiness to just end. I feel like a husk of what I used to be I used to be able to be happy, motivated, and felt like I could do anything I put my mind to. Now I constantly have a feeling of boredom, I’m so unmotivated that I have to force myself to do anything school related, and now my first question to myself when I do school work is why am I doing this how is this helping me.

So sometimes I just want to walk away go for a drive maybe because that’s the only thing I really enjoy anymore because I have to drive to go places. So it is fun being by myself in the car when it is only me and the road in front of me no noise no music just peace. Especially when drive a 4:00AM and it’s me and my car just that.

I also splurged a little money on a sports car from my weekend job and it’s the only thing I really love and when I get home I take the keys out of the ignition and just kind of sit there no phone no anything I just sit. Not even thinking just sitting. Because I know the second I leave the car all that stress all that worry comes back.

Anyways do any of you know what I should do to fix myself because I really just want to stop doing everything. I also think I might just be lonely and someone to talk to would be nice. I also am not saying I’m giving up on college that is the last thing I want to do. But I just can’t stop feeling this way.",7,1,0.67,GenZ,7,Sunday,Evening

1c4ae8n,2024-04-15 01:48:15,Why do so many in Gen Z like socialism?,"What the title says.

All economic systems seek to solve the same economic problem:

The output of a country is limited, so what goods and services should be produced and how should they be distributed?

Socialism attempts to solve this problem with a central authority that determines what should be produced and where those products should go.

Leaving aside the obvious potential for corruption, this system only works as long as the central government authority remains in touch with what goods and services the people want; which often does not last for more than 3-4 generations without serious issues.

As a result, socialist countries generally have lower average standards of living than capitalist countries.

Given all this and the numerous historical examples of socialism failing, why do so many in Gen Z seem to want to implement it?",128,0,0.37,GenZ,9,Monday,Night

I'm 17 and don't really have any friends to distract me from my interests so that's no option.
I like my little pony, animanga, fanfiction, danmei, read comics and I like to make games on roblox sometimes. My only big projects I've ever completed are roblox games, fanfiction and anime art. I spent my 17th birthday sobbing because I have to be an adult now and give up on the childish stuff I love. A lot of people may argue that there's nothing wrong with my interests, and there wouldn't be if I only liked one of these things but combined with all of the others? It's honestly quite childish. Danmei for example is quite adult, however mixed with my other stuff ? Childish...

I had a media teacher a few months back whod just regularly pick on me after noticing I had a pony sticker on my pocket sketchbook. She'd just regularly tell me to grow up and that I'm childish in front of all of my peers and i got so anxious attending her classes that I'd almost faint a lot of the time. Tho, no matter how harsh or mean she's correct. I'm an adult now and have to drop my immature interests. Most teachers are quite chill, especially with creative subjects and she was quite nice to everyone else so clearly im the proglem.

The fact that I can't even tell people irl about any of my interests is pretty hard proof of their/my inferiority.

Most Boomers are living paycheck to paycheck like the rest of us. What you see online is the reality most of them live. I mean, 70% of the world’s wealth is held by 1% of the population and a good chunk of them aren’t boomers.

Boomers lived a time of economic prosperity and took advantage of it. They were young and dumb kids who didn’t think that the economy was going to collapse. I mean, this is following their parents who saw the Great Depression, so they took hold the reins and ran with it. And even then, a lot of them didn’t succeed. 

I feel like this generational war is pointless. Yes, Boomers aren’t as knowledgeable in certain areas like we are, but there will be a time where our kids will say the same thing about us. I mean, we are already seeing young Gen z on TikTok blame millennials for not fixing the economy and they are only a generation away from each other.

WHY DO WE FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE EVERYTHING A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE???? Like pleeeeeeeeeaseeeeee

You tell someone you don’t like something and the next thing they go, “oh, it’s your ADHD” like excuseeeeee meee???? I do not have ADHD.

The last straw for me was when someone heard me speak in one of my friend’s videos, for context, I sound younger than I am, what people would call “childlike” voice or whatever, but that’s just how I was born, I don’t have any issue. Then, I checked the comment section and some people were commenting, “her talking that way might just be a way of trying to heal her inner child” like what do you even mean??? There are people with high-pitched voice, it just HAPPENED. Has nothing to do with inner child pleaseeee. 

The other day, a friend was talking about how she doesn’t like traveling cos of how tiring it is and all that, and someone literally hit her with the “childhood trauma” thing and another, I can’t even remember what it is anymore, but it’s one of those mental health issues that the members of this generation have established and made internet (TikTok) famous. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

Like BFFR, some things just happen because they HAPPEN. Has absolutely nothing to do with any form of mental health issue or whatever. And this is not a post to trivialize mental health issues or invalidate the feelings or struggles of people who battle with one mental health problem or the other. But we have to stop tagging everything a “mental health” disorder.

You could tell someone you don’t like a particular food, and they go, “omg that is so OCD” or you tell them you like the comfort of your own space and they say, “yeah, I have it too, it’s called depression and social anxiety.” No, it’s not, leave me alone please. It’s not anything, I JUST DON’T like it.  

It’s almost like people just want others to associate themselves with one or two mental health issues, and I don’t even understand why.

It is so annoying. Let people be what they are without you attaching any mental issue to it. Please. I am begging.

1c3dt9j,2024-04-13 22:18:40,GenZ on the workfloor,"Hi everyone,

I'm a millenial (on the edge of GenZ) and I give communication training at work to all kinds of people. I'm asking you for some advice on how to deal with the following case. Just want to mention English is not my first language and I'm really not trying to make generalizations, just looking for answers from a broader perspective.  
This month I'm training a group of managers who have a specific question about how to be a good manager to GenZ, specifically those members of GenZ who are starting their first 'real'/grown-up job. These managers are all 40+ and they have a job in which you get to become a manager by having a lot of experience in the field - so they're not educated on management much (that's where I come in) - but they have a strong expertise in their field. Anyway, something they struggle with is staying in contact with the GenZ members of their team. Common situations are when they've asked an employee several times 'Do you need help?' to which they answer no, but then in hindsight it turns out they did very much need help but never asked (even though the managers reached out several times). Because of the nature of the work people often work remotely and this makes it hard for managers help proactively, the work asks for some independence (which already shows part of the issue since that's typically not what people need in the first year of their first job).   
Other struggles are GenZ using their phones a lot during work, and even though they've been asked not to because it affects the quality of the work, still not being able to beat that addiction/put it down, struggling to show vulnerability (not asking for help, not admitting they don't know how to do something, sharing any personal issues even if relevant to the work, overestimating themselves a lot in for example performance reviews but also the tasks they ask to take on). 

Obviously we're also looking into what the managers can improve, and the policy of the company itself etc. I'm also almost part of the generation so I do have some of my own answers on the following questions, but I want to look outside of my own bubble of my circle and of scientific sources I can find on this and ask these questions to you on Reddit, so:

**My questions are:**

\- Do you, GenZ members, also experience this at work (struggling to show vulnerability, admit mistakes, overestimating yourself, not sharing personal issues relevant to the work) and if so, what causes it for you?

\- What do you need from a manager in your job? What would your ideal manager look like?

\- How would you like your workplace to deal with phone use? 

Obviously if you have anything else to add or to share, please do so! I understand it's hard to judge a situation with this little details, I'm sorry for not being able to share more. Thanks in advance!!

They aren't hiring or they never call u and ik what ur thinking ""just call them nobody the world dont revolve around u"" believe me I've tried only thing I've heard is the dial tone cuz ig nobody can pick up a fucking phone orrrr ""we'll get back to u as soon as I can"" yea fucking right. Oh and best part 100% of jobs do online applications only and I can't apply to 90% of jobs because I don't have prior work experience and the last 10% I'm like wow this was super ez and fast. In the last half year. How many jobs I've applied to. I've gotten ONE interview and the Kady said she'd 100% hire me and that I did WONDERFUL and could never have been able to tell if this was my first interview and then I walked out those doors ANDDD she forgot my name face and number and everything 🙂 getting a job is so difficult atp it's fucling pointless and useless but then a numerous infinite amount of what if bad possibilities happen when u can't make money 🙂 ",24,8,0.79,GenZ,12,Saturday,Morning

I’m trying to understand the doomer mindset that many adopted on this subreddit. I see a lot of posts mentioning real common problems plaguing our generation such as the economy, social isolation, mental health crisis and many more in the current state of the world. Everytime someone on this subreddit posts some pretty good advice, it get dismissed or downvoted. Part of the reason may be that the posts are usually are written in a condescending/patronizing way or think they have the magical cure to all the problems, but it goes much deeper. It seems alot of us have given up and became hopeless that their situtation wont get better even if they tried. While I agree that many of these problem do impact our lives one or another, It shouldn't keep from trying to make the best out of any situation. I believe there’s more to life than struggling and being miserable. However, everyone has their reasons for why they feel this way.

I've joined a few groups online for parents, and there are thousands of teens who refuse or can't go to school mostly due to mental health issues or bullying. Are any of you Gen-Z folks able to shed some light on this? Was it a thing for you when you were in school? Did you know kids who just dropped off the face of the earth and stopped attending? What did you think of them? Did you go through a phase of not attending? Did you end up going back? What changed to help you get back to school? Is this a common topic on Tik Tok that's being spread as a thing to do if you're suffering? Why is this such a phenomenon now? Covid and home schooling? I'd appreciate any insight. Thank you.

1c2whko,2024-04-13 07:42:50,"We need a different way to think and talk about climate change, corporate greed, rising inequalities and new technologies like AI and biotech ","Not just as green, equality and regulation lenses to put on our societies and economies, but as an all-encompassing systemic approach, nothing less than changing the socioeconomic systems that drive our postindustrial societies and their rules. As many people discussed in frustrating length, the individual angle is overplayed.  

For such a systemic change in economics, politics, society and technology we need to influence the people at the levers. Politicians need and feel strongly that the people care, that their own success depends on tackling rapid climate change, corporate greed, rising inequalities and new technologies like AI and biotech. When governments are reluctant to change and make laws impacting their key voters, we need to vote them out and vote in people who respect science and facts. We need to hold them accountable for implementing the most effective strategies. Not waste our time with things like banning plastic straws and more tax on companies, but by moving the big levers. The top 1 percent and capitalism, marginalized communities, those affected by decarbonization, food, transportation, energy, overconsumption, mass extinction, topsoil loss, waste, construction, biotechnology and AI. Planetary boundaries like ocean acification, phosphorus and nitrogen runoff, freshwater withdrawal, land conversion, ecotoxicity and waste, topsoil loss and loss of species need to be respected.     

When industries fight against regulations and changing their ways or even being abandoned, for the fear of losses or in an honest attempt their own, we need politicians to step in and do force them. If they still don't cooperate, harsh regulations and laws need to force or bankrupt them. 

We need better laws like standards, investments, anticapitalist regulations and other regulations, we need better cities with more green spaces, denser, better housing in larger amounts, less cars and more car free transit. We need better infrastructure like nuclear and renewables, public transportation and bike lanes, adaptation infrastructure and natural spaces like forests and meadows. We need better agriculture like crop rotation, natural fertilizers, rewilding some fields and using less pesticides.

AI and biotech need regulation to prevent something like Cyberpunk or digital 1984 from happening. Privacy needs to be protected. Those impacted by future automation need something like universal basic income. 

Big companies need anti monopoly laws, bigger taxes and need to pay those unpaid. Ultimately, the need for profit needs to be removed together with capitalism.  

The Global North and companies need to pay off reparations to the Global South for decades of pollution, exploitation, slavery and destruction. The Global South needs to finally make independent decisions, not be influenced by the Global North, and be listened to by other countries. 

Subsidies for meat, fossil fuels and other harmful industries like the military need to be abandoned and funneled into renewables, nuclear, public transit and other low carbon solutions.               

Work needs to be reduced to 4 hours a day 4 days a week so you can have time for yourself, society, education and most importantly, having children.

The government needs to provide services like healthcare, education, housing, food and water, transportation, internet, energy, and ensure equality, political voice and ensure they're accessible to all citizens and that their basic needs don't impact planetary boundaries like climate change, ocean acification, phosphorus and nitrogen runoff, freshwater withdrawal, land conversion, topsoil loss, ecotoxicity and waste and loss of species.

Its pretty much the same with my mom and step dad.   
I'm aware it's not literally everyone. You don't have to list people you know who don't do that. But I swear I keep seeing that more and more. It doesn't seem healthy. It's normal to not spend every waking moment with each other and spend time with others

1c37g7p,2024-04-13 17:39:27,I don’t like being grouped into GenZ Because they think we are all the same dumb kids who don’t know anything. All though that May be true it’s just that I’ve understood concepts about society when I was 8 years old When people who have been living for 50 years still don’t understand.,"

One reason why I think I should not be grouped in with all of you is because most of you believe the lie about good and bad but the truth is that Good and bad don’t exist they are just terms that humans and religion made to control us. The only true law is the law of nature. What you view as good or evil is based solely upon your own perception. What you view as evil, someone else may view as good. These concepts are purely human and cannot be observed in nature. Good and evil do not actually exist. And at a microscopic level everything is made out of particles in life and there are no good particles or bad ones they are just particles moving around. So weather you kill or steal it’s all fundamentally the same thing it’s all just particles moving around. And this goes much more deeper and it explains a lot in life and even after life.

Good and evil have changed in within time. Just 200 years ago it was morally justifiable for a 50 year old to marry a 12 year old and everyone in society at that time looked at it as “good” but in today’s society they say “Oh he’s a sick bastard” it’s just whatever is wanted or unwanted in society at that time. This also disproves the existence of a god because 200 years ago everyone would say that 50 year old is going to heaven but 200 years later and if the same thing happens they will say the 50 year old is going to hell.
