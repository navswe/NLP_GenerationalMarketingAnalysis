It was part of our identity and we formed friend groups based on what music and bands we listened to and go to the concerts together.

1cd1ubg,1714077031.0,4th time moving across the country: my struggles as a young guy trying to navigate a broken economy,"Just wanted to rant a bit, because I'm feeling stressed out. I like to write when I'm stressed out. I thought my words might be able to relate to other young people coming of age in this era of high inflation and housing bubbles.

In January 2021, I moved from Cleveland to Albuquerque for an embedded internship while my school was remote/asynchronous due to the pandemic. I really loved New Mexico. This move was easy. I had a plane ticket, $2000 in my bank account, and a suitcase full of stuff. I wound up working my way up to a car. The job was great. I was only making $20/hr but I made many close friends and really discovered myself that year. I found my love of embedded, lifting weights, riding bikes, hiking, and the desert. I was happy. It was my first time being on my own and I felt like I crushed it.

At the end of the year, I had to move back to Cleveland to finish my schooling, which was a bit of a surprise to me. Two months after I got the news I packed up my car and made the 26 hour trek back to Cleveland. I wound up living in a condo my mom owned and finished up school. I had to pay rent, but she gave me a fair rate. I was not happy to need to survive another Cleveland winter, but hey, I graduated and was free. Or at least I thought I would be.

I applied all over the country, and by some strange twist of fate, I wound up getting a decent offer in New Mexico again in mid 2022. I had my whole life planned out. I was going to buy a house in the burbs with my salary and pay it off in a few years. I priced out the area and accepted the offer. Yet another 26 hour drive across the country with all my stuff in my car.

I made it about 6 months at the company until I realized that something was dreadfully wrong. This was during the 2022 housing spike, and the area I scoped out wound up skyrocketing 50% in price over the course of 6 months. I just wanted a tiny 2 bedroom house for 200k, which somehow shot up to 300k+. I was in disbelief.

Fortunately, I had a windfall. In January 2023 A buddy I worked with at my old job had a position open up for someone with my skillset, and they where in dire need of a firmware engineer. I applied, he sang my praises, and I wound up strong-arming the company into giving me a 60% pay bump. I was delighted, I thought I might actually be able to make it work out here after all. The only problem was that this company was a quasi-startup of sorts and had terrible, terrible management. I am proud of the work I did and my boss was very happy with me, but the money dried up. I wound losing my job 2 months ago.

Fortunately, I had seen this coming as I was not in the first wave of layoffs. I had my resume up on Indeed and wound up getting contacted by a recruiter at a big company working on a similar product to what I was working on out in the Chicago suburbs. I interviewed with them, and got an offer with a marginal paybump, maintaining my salary. On the same exact day the extended the offer, I got laid off at my job in ABQ. Once again, I had to move and had very little say in the matter.

I can't complain, I am very lucky to have had something lined up for me after losing my job. Most people don't get that luxury. The area I am moving to is nice, but man, even fixer-upper starter homes are pulling 300k there. I'm not too excited about the winters, either. I'm going to do my best to love it but I'm not sure this place is going to be where I settle down. I have a feeling I'll be moving again in 2 years once I have enough money saved up to buy a house somewhere more affordable.

I'm also a little nervous because I'm kicking around the idea of marrying my girlfriend and I don't know how much she'll wind up making. She has an engineering degree but its from a Mexican University and we'll have some immigration stuff to deal with. I'm making good money, but even with that, how will I be able to provide for her while I try to pay off a house? I'm pulling 160k but what does that even mean if my standard of living is going to be, at best, living in a run down 1000sqft fart box?

I don't want to sound like I'm complaining because I have a lot of good stuff going for me, but man is it tough to make it in this economy. I'm getting very tired of moving and it really feels like every area I move to just wants to make as much money as possible off me and spit in my face. ""Want to live here? How about you take on half a million in debt for my old shit shack and pay $15k yearly in property taxes?"" The idea of kids are off the table completely for at least the next 8 years and I'm 26 now. I've done nothing but save money since I started working and it just feels like the more I save the more expensive houses get. Like, I'm not a bum. I sacrificed. I saved. I worked hard. I developed my skills. Why is it that the only things that are available to me are scraps?

I'm packing up my stuff right now to move again. Feels like I'm saying goodbye to an old friend leaving New Mexico. I didn't want to move but I felt like I have no choice. Sorry for the essay, I just felt a need to verbalize my struggles.",1,1,0.67,GenZ
1cd1mty,1714076575.0,Gen Zs wouldn't share weed,"
TLDR: young folks at public event wouldn't share doobie with old guy. Is this normal/common?


Had an interaction with some Gen Zers that makes me (59m) curious. We were at a professional sporting event in Calif, 100s of folks on a grassy area pregaming with food and alcohol. A couple feet away from my wife and I a group of four or five young adults, prob 18-22 yo, were passing a large joint around in their circle. The smoke was blowing right in my face and I thought it smelled pretty good so I stepped into their circle and said something like ""mind if I take a hit off that?""

I was denied. A male looked at me quizically with a half smile and said ""you're a stranger.""  I backed off immediately and said ""no problem guys, I don't wanna make any of you uncomfortable."" A girl then said (trying  nicely to explain), ""we just don't wanna get sick."" I said ""It's fine, don't worry about it."" And that was it. 

I've been smoking pot since early 80s and grew up with a ""share-the-wealth"" attitude; as long as there was enough weed, hell yeah, let's ALL get high. Maybe years ago weed was more illicit and we had a sense of ""partners in crime"" and ""stoners unite!"" If an older guy wanted to get high with us we'd LOVE it -- dude, we got high with an old geezer, so cool!

My questions:
1) is it common for younger folks to NOT share weed (or anything?) with strangers?
2) is it a post-Covid thing (of course we didnt have this years ago and I totally understand if this is the reason)?
3) is it the anti-Boomer thing that I read so much of on Reddit?
4) Is it because weed is so prevalent that folks think ""get your own""?

1ccrnkt,1714050886.0,I don‚Äôt really buy the whole going out is too expensive ,"As the title says I don‚Äôt think that saying it‚Äôs too expensive to go out is that valid of an argument, I think people just use that as an excuse to not socialise. I think that argument is valid for people living in rural places with fuck all to do but wasn‚Äôt that always the case? My dad grew up in a rural place and told me back in those days the only things young people did for fun was burn cars, fuck and do drugs, cause there was literally no where to go and the only way to do something was to move out of those places, and this is Australia so no Walmart, not even a target. Where he grew up was literally nothing but like once local tavern and a shooting range. 

In city and urban areas there is always something free to do. Bars are expensive yes but you don‚Äôt have to drink or you can drink beforehand. Like grab a few friends pitch in like $5 - 10 each and buy a bottle of vodka and takes swigs from it before going out, saves so much money and is exactly what my parents did. Or steal booze from your parents, again what my parents did when they were young. 

I was looking online and found posts of free music gigs in my city and there were literally so many. Like just free gigs to see like 4 different bands each night, it was insane, every day of the week there was tons of stuff. And I live in a relatively small city. Why don‚Äôt people do that? It‚Äôs good as well cause u socialise, find and support local music, have fun and maybe get laid. U might even find people to start a band with, it‚Äôs a common way of doing that. Art galleries are free, a lot of festivals are free, just going down shopping strips which still exist where I live, house parties, people‚Äôs houses, interest clubs, social meetups, parks, sight seeing nature, fishing, volunteering, just walking around or hanging out, skate parks, beaches, I‚Äôm sure ur families do things u can invite friends along too, camping is relatively cheap, cinemas aren‚Äôt too expensive, plus u don‚Äôt go to them very often, $20 every month or so to see a movie with friends isn‚Äôt that bad and so so much more stuff. Like so many free or inexpensive things to do. When people say stuff is expensive what stuff do they actually mean?? Like buying drink at nightclubs?? Definitely that costs waaauyy too much but they‚Äôre always ways around these things, be creative and find solutions. If u guys really wanted to have fun, you‚Äôd find a way. Like don‚Äôt buy drinks at a night club, drink before hand or pop a few pills before going in it‚Äôs literally a free night. I‚Äôm not a fan of nightclubs but if u like them I‚Äôm sure there are ways around the expenses. 

I guess going out for dinner is pricey yes, but hasn‚Äôt it always been kinda pricey if u do it often? Also if that‚Äôs all ur doing it‚Äôs a bit boring. It‚Äôs just one thing right?. Idk about conventions but again they don‚Äôt happen very often, it‚Äôs not a weekly expense. I also look around my college campus and at bars and see posters and ads for stuff like interest meetups or political protests, or meetings, clubs or art stuff, like why not go to that with friends? It‚Äôs all free. 

A lot of gen z still live with their parents, especially in cities, what r u spending ur money on if it is not rent?? I get if ur paying rent and working a shit ton its hard but sparing a few hours a week to hangout with friends isn‚Äôt that unreasonable?? Like going out every Saturday night for a few hours isn‚Äôt that insane of a time sink. I work 2 minimum wage jobs, I work like 25 - 30+ a week and study and still manage to find the time to party and do stuff even with my social anxiety. Maybe if ur studying medicine it‚Äôs hard but most people aren‚Äôt doing that. Idk if people just use the cost of going out as an excuse to not socialise but it feels like it. 

What r ur thoughts. I just noticed this when looking for gigs and realised most of the gigs in my city were free!!! And that‚Äôs just rock, indie and metal shows there are probably tons more for rap cause it‚Äôs more popular ",13,0,0.42,GenZ

In this ever-evolving world, Gen Z stands on the verge of a mega technological leap, where AI has much to contribute. They are smart to focus on more productive tasks by assigning their redundant assignments to Chat GPT, but they also fear job losses, which are inevitable as we move into the future. AI is becoming more intelligent with each passing day, as evidenced by the entry of Devin AI, although it is still not capable of replacing engineers. However, it is capable enough to replace entry-level work. Let‚Äôs consider the comments from the official video released by Cognition Labs to introduce Devin. Students were so frustrated. Some suggested that it should be called Devil instead of Devin. Others expressed heartbreak, mentioning that they were attending a boot camp to learn coding and build a career, only to be disheartened by Devin‚Äôs capabilities. Some even went as far as to say that software engineers are digging their own graves by building such models. All this shows that Gen Z is just worried about their future prospects and how they will achieve success in such a competitive environment, which is further magnified by these AI technologies.

1cb7oye,1713886656.0,"Gen Z isn‚Äôt lazy, but college did a terrible job of preparing us for what life actually is and what it requires. ","I see a lot of posts about leaving college and rent and debt and how hard it is to get a job and do taxes and shit (even though it‚Äôs like the easiest it‚Äôs ever been in our society to do those things, but hey I was never taught how to do that shit either)

But I‚Äôm also genuinly starting to be convinced a lot of young people these days went to college purely because they wanted to stay students and kids for longer, drink and party and have fun in their early adult years and when they realize they actually have to pay for it or they actually have to get a job with their degree and work. 

Like bro, if you didn‚Äôt wanna go into debt, why did you go to a college that costed you 100,000 a year? Well I think I know why. It‚Äôs because smaller colleges don‚Äôt have as much fun. It‚Äôs expensive to go to UPenn or UMD or USC or Arizona state, or any large university. There are more people there, more bars, more opportunities to have fun and get a part time easy job or get an internship because they‚Äôre located in or near big cities, and they‚Äôre also MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE. But I don‚Äôt think people really go to college for education anymore they go because it‚Äôs a social experience. You get to spend your young adult years still getting spring breaks, summer breaks, holiday breaks.

And then the reality sets in when they graduate and they‚Äôre $40k in debt (for loans that they willingly took out) and they realize living actually requires effort.

But also, colleges feel designed like that now. I‚Äôve even heard people say ‚Äúcollege isn‚Äôt about the education really, it‚Äôs about the social experience.‚Äù And then I realized that may be the biggest problem with our generation. We aren‚Äôt fucking lazy, we just were never properly prepared for reality.

I‚Äôve also seen this attitude (though much less frequently) from younger parents. I always get pissed when younger parents are like, shocked or pissed that they can‚Äôt go out on weekends because they have a baby. Or they ‚Äúhave no social life‚Äù Like they didn‚Äôt expect being a parent to be a full time thing.

Like, no. I hate to be this fucking guy, but, your carefree life is genuinly over. Now is the time where you actually have to put in effort to live. It has been that way in every society since the dawn of humanity, that at a certain point, there is no more play whenever you want. 

I hate the ‚Äúadulting sucks‚Äù meme and shit people say about it because yeah, no shit, it‚Äôs been that way for thousands of years and it will be that way for thousands more. Being an adult fucking sucks, actually working fucking sucks, no matter what you do it‚Äôs still work. Having obligations sucks. 

Leaving college and getting a job and a house was honestly a kick in the nuts for me. I had friends that were still in college that wanna go out all the time, play video games late, drink on weekdays. That may be the life for a select few, but I feel like people don‚Äôt want their easy college schedules and lives to end. They think that when they get a job in whatever field they studied, it‚Äôs gonna be the same.

And ultimately when they‚Äôre hit with a reality they didn‚Äôt expect, I think we get so many rant posts about how hard it is to balance life, spending time with friends and working when you have bills and rent and people to take care of. Now you have to buy your own food, your own clothes, clean your own house.

Some have more experience with this than others, but I think people in our generation are convinced that the college experience prepares them more for life than it actually does. Because it really doesn‚Äôt, not even close.

After being graduated for about 2 years now, I can tell you, college was so fucking easy and I don‚Äôt think my life was ever easier. And I think a lot of older Gen Z are coming to this realization and it‚Äôs hitting a lot of younger Gen Z right now.


TL;DR Gen Z isn‚Äôt lazy, people just think we are because we bitch about shit that we should‚Äôve expected (but weren‚Äôt prepared for because college doesn‚Äôt actually teach us how to be adults.) I don‚Äôt blame Gen Z, I just think we should‚Äôve been prepared better.


Edit:

I think people are confused and I didn‚Äôt make myself clearer: this isn‚Äôt my experience. This is my response to all the ‚Äúwhy is adulting so hard‚Äù mfs who post in this chat and are coping about how they can‚Äôt find a job.
I found a job, I am big chilling, this was about mfs in our generation who didn‚Äôt grow the fuck up and realize college should be where you go to learn how to work in a career and not a place where you can pretend to be a child. But that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs become for a lot of people.


I was saying it as a bad thing that a sizeable portion of people go to college basically to ride the whole school thing for 4 years as an adult to avoid the reality of being an adult and when they complain about it in this sub it‚Äôs cringe and annoying. 

Mf you took the loans out, you got a shitty degree, you went to college because you wanted to have fun and now you‚Äôre shocked that you never learned how to budget your money or write a resume. 

TL;DR: I‚Äôm tired of this sub being about people complaining about debt and rent and capitalism and how fucking hard everything is. Grow up. Life is hard, college was easy, you‚Äôre privileged to even have been able to go. Stop complaining about your existence, join the fucking army or something, and stop asking for 3 day work weeks where you get to work from home because you‚Äôre used to getting coddled by your huge university.

This post is extremely long so bear with me,
 
It never occurred to me that so many people rely on their phones to live until recently, around the end of 2021 I uninstalled social media and pretty much have used nothing except YT and Reddit which I would use every now and then, but now that I‚Äôve picked up the habit of leaving my phone and airpods at home I constantly observe what other people do and my God all those boomers who said that kids can‚Äôt live without their phones weren‚Äôt lying, I understand needing it for actual emergencies but so many kids (at least in my city) always lose their shit whenever a teacher confiscates their phone or tells them to put it away, I also realized that phone usage makes people very incompetent of doing any serious tasks for a long period of time, any time I go to the library with other students to study so many of them take breaks like every 15 minutes and make more time to scroll on TikTok or Instagram for 30 minutes or more, it‚Äôs almost like they cannot focus with opening social media; the worst part is that what we do is reflected onto the younger generation, any time I look at middle schoolers so many of them speak and act like they‚Äôre either social media influencers or they can‚Äôt converse about anything that isn‚Äôt related to social media. 
The other issue is that on social media we have a variety of influencers:

A) The super popular ones like Charli damelio, because of mass media usage I overhear so many people wanting to do ‚ÄúContent Creation‚Äù as a side hustle or as their actual career‚Ä¶

B) Skincare / Beauty influencers

This ones has hit its peak 2023 and now the amount of people who post daily about their skincare routine and just blindly lead their followers into a trap of consumerism is insane not to mention the looksmaxxing people which I‚Äôve come across even here on reddit, which is making people think that the only way you can be deemed as even slightly attractive is if you look like an A list super model.

C) The ‚ÄúBody positivity‚Äù Influencers, 

being in America already there is a large amount of obese citizens but as I age I see that there is more & more of them and so many are becoming social media activists and are quite literally promoting obesity to their younger audiences and pulling the ‚ÄúAll bodies are healthy‚Äù bs. 
red flag right there.

D) Red pill Alpha male incels

Probably one of the worst ones right now on Youtube I‚Äôve come across so many shorts of either fresh & fit or Andrew tate spewing the most obscene pieces of advice to their young male audience, saying things like 
‚ÄúYour wife should stay with you if you cheat‚Äù
‚ÄúIf she doesn‚Äôt cook a 5 course meal for you every day then she‚Äôs not the one‚Äù 
and so many more unrealistic standards for women I wont lie, I see many young women feeling entitled as well, with the sprinkle sprinkle stuff and all of them wanting to marry millionaires and fighting for pretty privilege and such, but what the men give as advice is quite literally just tutorials on how to emotionally and verbally abuse their spouses. 

E) Aesthetic influencers

Since quarantine up until 2024 the idea of fitting into certain aesthetics has grown but 2021 till today is when it genuinely started to grow at a rampant rate, any time I talk about fashion with other people of Gen Z the first question they always ask is ‚ÄúWhat aesthetic is that?‚Äù Which it isn‚Äôt offensive but the idea of only fitting into one category in terms of lifestyle and how you dress is incredibly stupid imo.

Another thing about excessive media consumption is the way everything has to be watered down or have a trigger warning like omfg, the other day one of my friends got kicked out of her other friend group because she said that spanish music wasn‚Äôt really her taste and they all found it ‚ÄúiCRedIBlY oFfeNSiVe‚Äù like bro üò≠ you‚Äôll be fine if someone doesn‚Äôt agree with you for once.

1cbgzhj,1713908809.0,College does help,"The constant bitching about how college suck, doesn't prepare you for the real world blah blah. It's all whiney unhelpful bullshit, thst misses the point. 

I'm here to explain to yall what all these post are missing. Don't get me wrong, college has a price problem, I'm not doubting that, but half the complaints are just not true. So here is a list of all the things you get from a traditional 4 year college

1. Learning/assistance moving out.

Most college require living in a dorm. People underestimate how important this is. It teach you how to live with other people, and depending on the context it can be used as renting experience. For people who have never left their parent house, having a safe structured place to move out to is huge. 

2. Learning how to self manage time. 

Some might have had this experience in highschool, but the reality is college may be the first time you actively are responsible for showing up to places. Not only that but learning how to focus on boring task like studying for hours at a time is a major skill help in all kinda of work.

3. Learning how to navigate buecracy.

School have websites, admission, it help desk, and the much more, just like the real world. You get to learn how to interact and work with in these system.

4. How to email people.

In other words basic professional communication. You've written papers, and you've emailed professors. Don't underestimate this, because God damn is it obvious when someone doesn't know how to send an email.

5. Job fair, and job advice.

The biggest problem irl is that people don't know what jobs are out there, and ""googling it"" will never be enough if you don't know what to google. Job fair and talking to your professor allows you to broaden the scope of what is out there and find a career for you. Bonus point for internship that really happen from college, giving you literal job experience.

6. Friend and connections.

College is a place where you can meet some of the greatest people who can affect your life in amazing ways. Not only with just friendship, but in career ways as well. You'd be suprised how often people find jobs through friends.

7. Managing your own money.

College will be the first time people have to actively manage their own money. If you think every college student is just collecting debt living the highlife your delusional. There is a reason they joke about college kids eating Ramen 3 meals a day. 


8. A fucking degree.

Literal proof that you have learned all the above. The amount of job that just want a 4 year degree and don't care which is higher then you think, and it's not because their stupid, it because they know for a fact if you have the paper you can atleast show up to class and turn work in on time, 

If you don't get anything out of college, I'm sorry to say maybe that your fault. College is overpriced and Student debt can be crippling, but thats not because college offers nothing. You have the option to take advantage of the network college provides, to get the most out of the experience.

TLDR: college provides a stepping stone from highschool and the real world, one where you get skills, and a safe place to explore what you want to do the rest of your life

Now if politicians WANTED change, this would be positive, but they dont want change that serves the people over the corporations

Lets look at some good case studies.

We will take 4 states with veto proof majorities: California, New York, Texas, Florida

in all 4 states, the minority party has ZERO representation in government, and thus the majority has free reign. We should come up with a fix for that, but thats a different discussion.

Lets start with the republicans and their platform pulled from their website:

""Republicans believe in liberty, economic prosperity, preserving American values and traditions, and restoring the American dream for every citizen of this great nation. As a party, we support policies that seek to achieve those goals.¬†Our platform is centered on stimulating economic growth for all Americans, protecting constitutionally-guaranteed freedoms, ensuring the integrity of our elections, and maintaining our national security.""

\*looks at texas and florida

.......bullshit

now for Democrats

""Democrats believe that the economy should work for everyone, health care is a right, our diversity is our strength, and democracy is worth defending. Democrats across the country are working hard to build a better America. We‚Äôre fighting to build an economy that works for everyone by lowering costs for working families and investing in the middle class. Democrats are dedicated to ensuring a stronger and more just future for every American.""

\*looks at new york and california

........bullshit

when faced with ZERO opposition, neither dems or repubs will do what they say. 

\*looks at approval rating for politicians in these state.....bingo! 

The problem with trifectas is that when you innevitably fail to pass the bullshit you tweet about, there isnt a scapegoat. You cant point a finger to the other side being obstructionist.

Biden had a trifecta. Remember when legalizing weed would have been the easiest thing ever and a total layup on republicans.....but he couldnt do it with a trifecta? Cant point to republicans because they arent in power......AH lets blame manchin, he is a good scapegoat. if not manchin then sinema, or the filibuster.......lots of excuses

remember when trump was going to build the wall? What happened? you had a trifecta! just sweep it under the board, or blame McConnell for not playing ball. more excuses

I still listen to the same music in the same genres. I still play the same exact games (at least the same types of games).

The environmental protection group's cubs are clamoring for environmental protection to be handed over to the descendants of the global environment, but do you care about the future environment?




Even if I were to protect the environment, those cubs that would exist in the future wouldn't thank me anyway, and it doesn't matter to me who will live in this land for less than 100 years, but it's just my hard work? That's a lot of nonsense




Worries about low birth rates, environmental concerns, and so on are all brainwashed. Who do you want to like?




There should be no intention of practicing environmental protection, but rather living with the intention of destroying the environment as much as possible.




You can spit out phlegm on the street, pee, throw cigarette butts, spit out gum, use a lot of disposable containers, throw trash anywhere, and don't separate them at home, and hit them all in a standard garbage bag.




You should never use eco-friendly products such as detergents and soap.




It is reasonable to live with a mind to practice environmental destruction within the range of daily life.




Since humans exist anyway, the environment is bound to be destroyed, and humans themselves, who are selfish and hypocritical than anyone else, are cancer cells.




Factory operations, industrial facilities, wastewater from those places are much more environmentally polluted, and if you ignore that and encourage individual environmental campaigns, it's just brainwashing



What's wrong with destroying the environment when it doesn't have a big impact on individuals doing more or less environmental protection? There is no need to overdo it.




Rather, it is more beneficial to live with the mindset of contributing 0.001% to environmental destruction than environmental protection.




It becomes difficult to live together, so if mankind is destroyed, there will be no need to worry about the environment.




Therefore, the environment must be destroyed and all humans must disappear from the earth.




Humans are the most harmful beings on Earth, and it is contradictory for humans to claim environmental protection.

Not everyone has rich parents who can pay for their college, car, house, etc and ask their business friends to get them an easy desk job to solve their problems. Not everyone has had it as easy as you have. Other people exist and have different experiences.

Seems like an obvious life lesson people should have learned by the time they finish middle school but evidently not. Let's try to make basic empathy and compassion cool again, can we?

1cbrtme,1713941890.0,incrementalism and accelerationism are the 2 dumbest ideologies ive heard of,"ive recently come across 2 political ideologies i havent heard of before.....and man....theyre bad

before, let me just say that the way these ideologies work on paper is different than the actual things people advocate for with these, so ill just be criticizing the reality of these ideologies rather than what they are on paper. Also this is from the perspective of someone in the US

1) incrementalism

ok so this one.....i just dont get. incrementalism is essentially accepting the status quo and insisting on working within it. incrementalists despise the idea of doing anything outside the status quo system in order to change it, the only change can come from within and it must be small. So like.....Lincoln, FDR, LBJ, Reagan, WASHINGTON.....incrementalists would have hated them.

the problem with incrementalism is that it conditions you to accept breadcrumbs when you deserve more and more importantly could have gotten more. 

""I saw 2 $100 bills on the ground, and i picked 1 up! what a lucky day!""

Another glaring problem....is not so much with incrementalism itself, but rather the people who advocate for it. I notice they miss the forest for the trees alot.

Like imagine you totaled your car, an incrementalist would say its more important to repaint it than to put the front bumper back on. Its weird....they take pleasure in and prioritize fixing small problems before big ones. Ever hear someone cop out and say ""well we cant accomplish X big problem until Y unrelated menial problem is fixed"". Like they have to find excuses to give up on stuff.

ill never forget my debate with an incrementalist, where I essentially told them: ""your solution to slavery and the holocaust is just to wait until all the racist people die of old age, you wouldnt allow revolutionary action"". They were left speechless and tried to backtrack saying how its different from modern working class oppression.

Last thing ill say about incrementalism is that it leaves too much room for the erasure of progress. Example. Lets say you take 1 step forward, and then 4 years later you take 1 step back, rinse and repeat. Have you really made progress? How about we strive for stuff that the elites cant strip away in 4 years, or we can keep regardless of the outcome of an election? 

Incrementalists will never trade comfort for progress, but they will tweet and virtue signal about it

2) accelerationism

kind of the opposite problem really.

to be as fair as i can....I get why accelerationism looks good on paper. youre ripping off a bandaid. accelerationism basically states ""things are getting worse, they will only ever get worse, lets just speed it up to minimize casualties and oppression"". Admittedly its a good theory.

Look at the inevitable failing of the status quo, and let it come to its logical conclusion faster. ""Fast to fail, fast to rebuild"" as I was taught in my engineering classes.

Interestingly, accelerationism is something i see libertarians and communists both come together on....how wholesome. 

Accelerationism has two main problems

firstly, accelerationism doesnt prioritize the working class. Its just a free for all, strongest will emerge from the ashes. this is not necessarily  the best approach for working class liberation when it doesnt involve class collaboration

secondly, and this is probably the biggest problem, accelerationism is redundant. I dont really understand why its more desirable than just normal revolutionary action. Like sure, accelerating the decay of the current system is fine, but just seizing it externally and starting over seems faster. Like it just seems counterintuitive.

The GOAL of accelerationism is better than incrementalism, its just less thought out.",11,2,0.62,GenZ

1cabugm,1713795185.0,Kids shouldn't have phones.,"Coming from a 16 year old guy...
I've heard people say that you shouldn't give your kid a phone until you're ready for their childhood to end. I didnt realize the extent to which kids are effected by them. Attention spans are diminishing by the day, innocence is lost, and kids aren't playing with each other anymore. Crucial aspects of childhood are lost due to lazy parenting and unmonitored screen time (and societal car dependancy but thats a story for a different day). Kids are also starting social media way too early. I've seen 7 year olds on tiktok, YouTube shorts, and even instagram. If you've seen the state if instagram lately, you'd see that its no place for a child. There's so much unhealthy activity on that app lately. Comment sections are filled with racism, misogyny, homophobia, the whole deal. Ignoring whatever personal views you have on these topics, kids internalize things more than others. Being surrounded by this much hatred, regardless if its a joke, isnt good for anyone, let alone young minds. Those young girls that are obsessed with skin care and anti aging products have been fooled by consumerism presented to them through their phones. The lululemon and stanley cup girls as well. The issue of kids being overexposed to the internet is a bigger problem than it appears. It could be addressed in multiple ways. Tightening minimum age standards on social media apps (or actually enforcing them) is an obvious option, but phone manufacturers should offer a more kid friendly phone, aimed more at communication with family, or real friends, rather than strangers. Parents also need to stop giving their kid a screen just to get them to shut up. Many parents use their need to communicate with their kids as the reason they've given their kid a phone, but many simply have unrestricted internet access, which is very dangerous at a young age. You could argue that restricting internet access to children is censorship, however, if children need the internet for information,  they can pay a visit to their local library, ask a parent for help, or inquire of a teacher.

1cbizhp,1713913797.0,Help me tackle my growing Doomerism,"As the title says, I used to be a really politically active and enthusiastic Teenager. Worked for the Bernie Sanders Campaign, Helped in Local Election, Attended Protests and Marches, Debated constantly against ideologies and people whose mind would be seeped in Conservatism, Sexism, Etc. 

Now however, the older I grow and the more information I read in regards to Climate Change, Political Lobbying, Gerrymandering, Proxy Wars occurring around the world, the rise of conservatism and far right ideologies around the world (Among us Gen Z folks as well), the inability to convince people to even listen to my ideas about challenging the systems of Capitalism (I cant even get through my friends and family anymore) & simply participating in society and seeing my lack of ability to do any meaningful change, I am becoming less & less caring about the world or even my fellow humans.

For example recently XQC & ADIN ROSS had a debate on Trans people and the comments section was ridiculous. So many of those people who are spitting hateful and harmful language towards the Queer Community are Gen Z and Gen Alpha. The growing Rise of Red-Pill & Far Right Conservative spaces with even some of the people I know in my personal life turning to conservatism and hate towards Immigrants (Which I am), woman (My sister has seen this in her own life in the dating market wherein she gets hated on by men for stating she does not want to have children), the response from so many Hindu family members of mine towards the support of Isreal and the general destruction of my Muslim brothers and sisters, the demonization of Science in real life conversations I have had with people I meet in public libraries (It being fake and Liberal), Educated Family members saying Climate Change is part of life and they wont stop to think of the world since they are on their way out. 

I feel so exhausted even with even Liberals and Far Left folks who now no longer understand that people can make mistakes and that conservatives and others arent bad people who we should give up on. So many people I talk to these days in public settings swear by the idea of cutting off everyone who does not align with leftist politics. So many of them find enjoyment In moral superiority and the idea that they have never done a bad thing in their life, often forgetting to give empathy and understanding to why some people may have taken those steps in their life. Some of them don't even give a chance to people who have changed their minds, pointing to their past as indicative behavior of who they truly are. However at the same time I feel like perhaps they are right, I should give up on convincing anyone on the right or middle because I feel like my words are simply falling on Deaf Ears.   
  
Moreovere, so many leftist and Liberals ignore that minority communities (Which I am a part of, Queer/Brown) have such terrible individualism. So many times I feel betrayed by fellow Asian, Black, Queer, etc who see harmful content or Unfunny Jokes and say, ""I am not offended, you are just being melodramatic."" There is no community cohesion anymore even among liberals and leftists and minority communities. 

Finally, the nail in the coffin for me these days is simply the lack of empathy or sympathy. So many people these days saying if you don't like the system, you are just a loser who is not motivated to Mental Health isn't real to Man UP to ICKS to I turned out fine and people no longer want to take responsibility to citing religion and person convictions as fundamental rules of life (Devoid of Secularism or Different Way of thinking) to MY PAIN MADE ME GROW, I WILL DO THE EXACT SAME THING MY PARENTS & COMMUNITY DID TO ME TO REST (refusing to understand different people react differently to Pain, Betrayal, lack of emotional support, abuse, etc)   
  
This and even more experiences has been getting to me and I slowly think we are simply doomed. I feel like even if we achieve some sort of change or revolution, the world we will inherit will be too far gone and broken.   
Someone said on some reddit post, ""Your hope is misguided and unfounded. Just because you find emotional comfort in delusion, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to enable it,"" in response to people calling them out for being a Doomer and I cant help but agree.

1cb83se,1713887640.0,Dating apps and social media have killed our humanity,"I think that dating apps ruining dating. But even beyond that, social media has had the same effect on our entire lives but more subtly. Why?

**Dating Apps Give The Illusion of Infinite Choice**

If someone doesn't like one little quirk about you, they can decide to end it or ghost you. In their mind, the ""plenty of fish in the sea"" mentality is real. However, we have taken this too far in dating apps. People are looking for someone who is exactly like them, or someone they have too many values aligned which doesn't push them to rethink their values. Having someone who thinks differently than you can be a great thing. Especially when you're going through a tough time and need a different perspective on something.

**The Effects of Social Media**

I think social media has had a similar effect. We have people who have thousands of friends and followers on social media apps but still say they feel lonely. The same way that people throw people away on dating apps, they throw friends away IRL because they think they will always be able to have a connection with someone.

However, real friendships can take a while to build as you need to spend a certain amount of time with someone in reality to build real trust. You cannot make REAL friend online. Sure, there might be people you meet and can talk to but that deeper level of friendship can only be found in real life.

I have a friend that I only know through social media and I do consider him a good friend of mine. But would I go out of my way to do something for him? Probably not. He wouldn't expect the same as me either. If we did grow our friendship in real life and made time for each other, I think the friendship would blossom more but that's a challenge considering we live in different states.

**Conclusion**

Trust can take a while to build with someone. Some things can accelerate that trust but generally, you will never find that online. Social media and dating apps are designed to be addicting because we think we are going to win something that we are missing, which is companionship.

The only way to find companionship and friendship is to do it in real life. Online friends and dating is the equivalent of junk food for the soul. Sure it may nourish it enough to keep it alive but over a certain amount of time, it will become malnourished.

But we‚Äôve been conditioned for years by social media apps to a cheap dopamine addiction that can only be fulfilled with more scrolling. We want to get off of our devices, but it can be really hard because they are so ingrained in our lives. Not only does this hurt us individually, but it hurts our society and culture. I think it‚Äôs really important to take measures to reduce your screen time as much as possible. Personally, I use a screen time tracking / motivation app called BePresent, never let my phone enter the bedroom, silence all notifications, and leave my phone in grayscale mode. Doing these things ensures that I‚Äôm using my phone only as the tool it was meant to be, instead of getting sucked into a toxic social media doomscroll hole.",6,0,0.45,GenZ

1cb6ue2,1713884510.0,"Enshittification doesn't apply to just the internet, but everything really ","This was originally meant to be a rant on the declining quality of services, mostly those online, AKA enshittification, but it applies to everything. 

All social media apps have a shitton¬≥ of bugs. YouTube is toxic to its creators and its community. Twitter is dying and promoting right wing bigots. All the internet is littered with ads. Google is now an advertising pole where you make it to the top if you pay for it. 

But it's not just online services. Everything else is shitty and colorless, devoid of life, sucks our your soul and corporate.  

Look at what is outside our houses. 100 years ago, there were ornamented townhouses in different colors. Cars were colorful. Heck, even in the 80s they were colored with even roofs being a different color from the car's main body. Now? It's just bland white, grey, and black landscape. Can you name car colors other than just black, grey, white, red and blue? No! Now buildings are just dirty, white, grey and black with rows of undecorated mass produced apartament blocks, dirty and neglected public service buildings and transit stations and stops, sprawling malls and parking lots, as well as ads and billboards everywhere. 

Ads thrash every place they occupy. I really don't want every thought, view and so on to be interrupted by an information I need to buy stuff. You can see near the border between Poland and Germany when the border is because looking from the German side you see where the billboards on the Polish side start.      

Everywhere else is the same. Even if you live in an area with trees and greenery, it's the same everywhere else. Clothes and shoes? All these are black, grey and white with a little bit of dark colors like red and blue. Furniture? The same, black, grey, white and dark colors. Home interiors? The same. 

Everything now is just corporate. Every piece of art is alegriaart. r/fuckalegriaart. The weird proportions, colors, etc. are fucking boring, bland, weird and suck your soul out, they look shitty.   

Clothes now break after a few months or years even when you stay the same size. When you buy phones and computers, they seem top notch but after a few years, they seem like an impediment to communication. The only things changing in PCs are the tiny things in the corner. Too bad, you can't replace it, every new model has a different shape, so you need to chuck the whole thing and buy a new one. Phones don't change much or even at all from one generation to another, like iPhones but also pretty much all phone brands. 

Grocery stores are dirty and messy, there are store pallets and boxes everywhere. 

The content of social media is dopamine activators. Most TikToks, YouTube Shorts and Instagram reels nowadays are AI generated. Even if they aren't, they're made to be colorful and attractive. They bombard you with information and entertainment before you even analyze it. YouTube videos are now mostly around-20-minute videos with clickbaity-and-colorful-and-flashy thumbnails and titles. They are bombarding you with BUT FIRST, LIKE, SUBCRIBE, CLICK THE BELL AND FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM! THIS VIDEO IS SPONSORED BY TOTALLY-UNRELATED-COMPANY-THAT-IS-PROBABLY-SOMEHOW-RELATED! LINK IN THE DESCRIPTION! Social media and forum and game moderation mostly sucks. Forums that didn't suck are dead, while those that didn't are half alive and with a caste of VIP users and moderators shitting on any question because it was already posted, because they don't like the thing you hate, or for any other BS. They'll give you a warning or outright ban you because you asked for links, or anything.           

If you buy things, you don't own them. Computer software, games, music and books are just licenses to use stuff. Everything is copyrighted and you can get sued and your video taken down for copyright claims, even if they're fake. 

Streaming platforms are just trash. They cancel good shows and remove good movies while the bad ones stay. They make you pay for stuff that should be free. Even if you pay, you are bombarded with ads. 

Games bombard you too. Even if they're paid for, you still have micro transactions. Moderation sucks. Even if the game sucks, the studio will blame anything but themselves. Things that should be in the base game, are in paid DLCs. Everything is paid for.

According to Public Health's article ,‚ÄúJust How Harmful Is Social Media? Our Experts Weigh-In.‚Äù social media can affect peoples' mental health and confidence which could worsen their way of how they view society and worsen disorders people might have.

Coming from personal experience, sometimes when I see people who look like models, I compare their pictures to my current self, and being a bigger person, it makes me feel insecure about my appearance. Also as an artist, when I upload my artwork on social media, not only I notice small errors, but I also look at other artists getting more likes than me and I think to myself ""Is my art bad, What am I doing wrong?""

""For those vulnerable to developing an eating disorder, social media may be especially unhelpful because it allows people to easily compare their appearance to their friends, to celebrities, even older images of themselves.""

Social Media can leave a negative impact on people but also leave positive impacts too

In the same article, Mellins stated social media can be used to help teens find out who they are. For introverted people, social media can be a great way to find new people

I've been diagnosed with autism since I was in daycare, and when my parents told me I was diagnosed with it I didn't think anything of it. But as I got older, I noticed how much its effecting me. For a while, I knew about the basic facts about autism, but I wanted to get more info. I went on Instagram and found many posts about autism (masking, stimming, need for routine, etc.) and it helped me get a better understanding about my disability and made me feel relieved that I'm not the only one who goes through the same problems

anyway. My wife and I are both early Gen z and have been talking about what we want to be different for our kids and the biggest thing we have both discussed is our hatred of the modern education system.  
Our biggest problems are: (you can skip to the **tldr** if you want)  
  
-Lack of Real-World skills (think budgeting/cooking/trades skills etc.) yes we both know there is some of this but we don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs accessible especially since when we were in school all these ‚Äúextra‚Äù classes were at the same time‚Ä¶ first period‚Ä¶ but the two of us were in band at that time and didn‚Äôt want to give that up.
  
-Lack of ‚Äúpersonalization‚Äù. We both know personalizing a student‚Äôs education is tough when you have classes of 500+ students but we both felt like we could have been pushed farther in school and we weren‚Äôt. (For example by 4th grade I was doing pre-algebra because I was teaching it to myself online but I couldn‚Äôt get taught anything like that at school)  
  
-Bullies, in school I especially saw how bullies get away with treating other kids like shit but the second someone fought back they were ‚Äúboth‚Äù being problematic and the victim would get in just as much trouble as the known bully. We don‚Äôt want our kids to deal with this kind of shit from school administration.

**TLDR: No life-skills, unpersonalized, bullies suck.**

What do you think about homeschooling your kids one day? I know there are downsides to it that I didn‚Äôt mention but I need to stop stalling on my work I‚Äôd love to hear some of your pros/cons and just generally what you think. **if you are a younger Gen Z still in school I‚Äôd love to hear what you think could be different too**

My goodness‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt play anymore but there are SO many memories attached to Call of Duty: playing with my brothers and friend. 

Summer where all we did was play endless rounds of Zombies (don‚Äôt do that anymore) and my obsession with modeling my play style after Pamaj and Spratt. 

My first COD was BO2, and stopped at the most recent Modern Warfare.

1cacrc7,1713797418.0,"Does it bug anyone else when older generations claim that financial struggles haven't changed across generations, from housing to groceries?","My uncle recently passed away on March 1st, 2024. He served in the Vietnam War, then worked hard for many years and was able to purchase a home, raise a family, and live a comfortable, even fulfilling life. Going through his stuff with my mom and his niece (who inherited the house), we found the original blueprints ‚Äì this modular home cost just $16,000!

He wasn't rich. He worked at EG&G Rotron, then spent 35 years at the Mohawk Mountain House in New York before health issues forced him to retire in 2021. But through it all, somewhere between his time in the Army and the Navy and before 1977, he helped build a church that's still active today. He provided for his family, had hobbies like his Xbox 360 (and loved shows like Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, and King of Queens), and never seemed to be worried about money. He embodied a certain version of the American Dream.

These days, it's more expensive than ever to simply afford to live.  An article I read said you need to make $111,738 a year to live comfortably in New York. Compare that to the minimum wage, $15/hour, which amounts to only $31,200 annually.  My uncle's story highlights how out of reach that basic comfort has become. 

His life was interesting, and I wish I'd known more to ask him about it. But the point is, it was a great life, well-lived. You didn't need endless possessions to have a fulfilling life. He had the necessities ‚Äì a roof over his head, food to eat, clothes on his back, and even his favorite shows on DVD (we found most of The Big Bang Theory collection, except seasons 6 and 12!).

Sadly, so many today struggle, and older generations (even my dad, a Gen-Xer) dismiss it with ""it's always been this way"". No, it hasn't. They like to say groceries were expensive back then too, and wages were lower, so the struggle is the same. But that's just not true. Wake up and look.  Even working two or three full-time jobs (if that were humanly possible), I'd still barely come close to living comfortably.  Is virtually impossible to do that today.

1caj9ju,1713812912.0,Why Doesn't Gen Z Drink?,"I posted this on the r/millenial sub but curious to hear from you guys actually as well as hear how opinions differ....

As a millenial drinking culture was big in high school and college but surprisingly for Gen Z it isn't. This is talked about a lot and generally agreed to be a healthy choice and a positive thing and I think it is ie less DUI's, drinking isn't necessarily horrible for you in moderation but probably isn't the healthiest of activities. In some ways the lack of the community and socializing that comes with drinking could probably even be seen as a negative.

I see this mentioned a lot but never really see reasons given, I was thinking about this while driving today and came up with 3 reasons why Gen Z doesn't drink...

Phone Cameras Back when I was in HS and college there were no cameras on phones. Worst case scenario you had to worry about someone taking a blurry throwaway camera pic of you. There were plenty of mornings I woke up with a traffic cone in bed with me, missing a shoe and aside from wondering oh man did I do something stupid anything would be pretty quickly forgotten. Today with cellphone cameras and even more so social media one bad decision lives forever. I do wonder if young people are wise/mature enough to realize this but it could be a reason.

Cancel Culture Today people really need to walk on tiptoes, say one bad thing whether you misspeak, said in jest or maybe even say something nasty while drunk but in todays world saying one wrong thing can lose you friends and get you cancelled. I think in all areas of life we tread much more carefully in regards to what we say, this could also be a reason.

Less Connection The last reason I think is probably the one most people assume is the case which is just that younger people are less social, people today report having less friends than people of a similar age in the past, people report being lonelier, less people are involved in sports teams and organized activities and more people just play video games at home, even those with friends often engage with them on xbox live or social media.

Obviously people change, every generation is different, people do different things but its weird how since pretty much the dawn of humanity people have drank, every generation from probably the 20s if not earlier had like a college culture, Ive seen the old ""party"" images on Reddit of colleges in the 30s.

I (16M) have been in contact with my dad since March of 2022. I (secretly) met him once in 2023. During that time I realized that something is a little ‚Äúoff‚Äù about him. This started to become more apparent after he told me some heinous things. He has called me a f*ggot and a p*ssy since he suspects that I‚Äôm gay. I confronted him about it, but he said not to worry about it since that‚Äôs just how guys talk to each other (???). I‚Äôve never had that many male friends growing up, but I find this strange. I do not live with him at all - I live with my mom. I‚Äôm not able to discuss my sexuality with anyone in my immediate family since they are catholic. I tried to bring it up with my grandmother, but, before I could really say anything, she said that gay people go straight to hell when they die. So, for now, I‚Äôm in the closet, and have been for a very long time. Anyway, here are some more of the things he has said. Let me make it clear: I DO NOT SHARE ANY OF THESE VIEWS WITH HIM. Here is a list of the things he‚Äôs said to me:

1) The holocaust was justified. He says that Jewish people are the enemy. He is a staunch Hitler supporter (!!!)

From all the relationship threads its lacking in that sort of view (Hopefully or due to survivorship bias since I am looking at the top posts)

Have any of you guys experienced abuse from your partner? How many of you guys have been able to talk about it?Any time I have tried to speak about my experiences of abuse I get very downplayed by everyone around me. Be it family or friends.

I have had relationships where I have feared for my life, I have had many times of speaking-stage to a girl where she states she will self-harm/(kill her self)  if I stop speaking to her. I have had many times where I wished to not have sex and they respond in crying and tears, talking about how I dont love them anymore. It has made me very jaded and somewhat afraid of a relationship because of these experiences.

I have not been physically harmed to this but I have been mentally harmed, I have been to therapy about it but its somewhat deep rooted.

I think the lack of being able to speak about this openly is due to these factors: Gender roles - man is viewed as stronger than a girl so that a girl couldnt harm a man; Men arent allowed to speak about their feelings - its less normalised and not in public view that people go through this, its unkown how many men go through this; People use this as a reactionary arguement to disvalue womens experiences - it just makes people angry when anyone really speaks about it.

1c9h1tg,1713703630.0,Does the world feel overwhelmingly apathetic to anyone else?,"Maybe this is too broad of a statement, maybe this is too big of a topic. Idk, but it's been haunting me. 

The more time I spend on social media the more it seems people really don't care about others. Or that their actions / words have consequences on the other end of a screen. And not just screens, or social media. I'm not saying the internet or phones are bad. 

What I've found most disturbing lately is internet trends which turn an individual human being into an ""NPC"" which that idea is inherently dehumanizing. 

Every person you see isnt a background character, or a side character. Every person you see isn't some piece of code written for a line of dialogue you hear in passing. Every line, every spoken word by every human has layers of personal information and lived experiences and unknown context baked into that foundation. Every person you see in public has a life as intricate as yours. Every person in this world is uniquely individual, and different, BUT at the same time, so similar.

It's been really popular recently to harass people In public for internet points or laughs without any thought for the person on the receiving end. I'm sure you've all seen those videos of guys going into stores and screaming, or yelling at someone then acting dumbfounded when they get in trouble. As if they cannot fathom their actions have consequences. If not check out r/imthemaincharacter for a perfect example of what I'm talking about.

It's this general state of apathy that has seemed to be spreading like wildfire through our little screens. And again, I'm not saying ""phones bad. The internet bad."" But I am pointing out that they have flaws, as there is never anything that doesn't have flaws (just like humans). 

Another thing, it seems others can't accept people for being who they are. We all have preconceived ideas and biases about the way things are and the ""proper"" way people ""should"" act. Obviously mine our that we shouldn't harass other people in public when it's likely they just want to be left to go about their business. While some others might believe that it doesn't matter because in the grand scheme of things nothing matters, so we can do whatever we want, and no one will be any different. 

Also looksmaxxing is so fucked. So is the other subs like r/rateme, where the quality of a person's value is placed only upon their exterior features. While no one in those subs considers the interior, or mind, which is the thing that literally runs every minor thing we do. It's as if you cannot be loved now if you do not fit a standard. Standards have always been in place, and especially held unfair over young woman for centuries. But with the internet anyone with a little time and access to wifi can uphold that unfair standard for young women, and give feedback in an unqualified position to do so.

Which leaves a lot of young women very insecure about their looks, and trying to fit a certain idea of what they ""should be."" When they shouldn't try to be anything except themselves. ALSO! Before anyone says anything, the same can be said for men but it is not as great of an issue. The standard for men is also inhibiting to young men, especially young men that don't fit the stereotypes that are expected of men. (This is also part of what's called the male loneliness epidemic.) 

We have all been groomed in one way or another to believe on a subconscious level that romance, or love, or relationships, or personality, or presentation have a distinct ""way they should be"" but that couldn't be any further than the truth. Everything is so nuisanced. That's like being told when you're a baby that every fruit you come across will be an apple, and if you come across anything else, its not an apple. So when an orange begins to grow, or a banana shows it's curves people will throw it to the side because it's ""not how apples are supposed to be.""


Another thing, as I state these opinions, and have stated these opinions before, I have / will get ridiculed and dismissed because of my personal point of view. I don't see why we can't read someone's take, evaluate it, and give a response that isn't baked in contempt or defensiveness. If you have a different opinion than I do, PLEASE SHARE IT! I'd love to hear it, I'm learning every day and I know I don't get everything right. No one ever gets everything always right. So I am learning, and we all are. So if I'm wrong, or you disagree, I'd love to hear what you have to say of you're willing to have a discussion about it. But if you're just attacking an opinion without any backing, or evidence just because you disagree with it then that's very counter productive.

 I see these comments everywhere. All across the world of the internet. We can't agree to disagree anymore, because we hate we don't agree with. We can't learn each other's perspective when we're too busy hiding in our own. 

Even now, after writing this all down, I don't think I fully got my point across, but I want to know what you all think about the feelings of modern day people, and your perspective of how they view others. 

Anyway I'm tired of thinking at this very moment, but I'm gonna go take a nap, so I'll be back eventually. Peace.",9,4,0.75,GenZ

I did a double take cuz as far as we were told, the guests were already on their way. Even if we could cancel, we couldn‚Äôt.

Dad did a double take too and laughed without humour. We just all shrugged and started cleaning.

So the guest came and went and my sister was doing homework and mom went and asked ‚Äúwhy you don‚Äôt ever tell us anything from school?‚Äù. Previously dad told my sister that it was rude and very‚Ä¶bad(?) of her to say smth like that. Sister just told that she was just expressing her opinion.

1c9ax3d,1713679977.0,We need more unique names.,"Yes, I know a lot of the people here aren't going to have kids, but those of us who plan to, we gotta start being original. And no, I'm not talking about naming kids ""rhyker"" and ""stephaneigh"" and ""charleigh-annye"", I'm talking about old school names.

It might be an unpopular opinion, but there are way too many Ryans, Aidans, Dans, Johns, Roberts etc, Who are my age. Obviously if you want to name your kid after a parent or grandparent or somebody, then that's all fine and well, but if you don't have any preference, go with something cool that'll stand out.

I'm talking about bringing back names like ""oliver"" and ""percival"" and ""beverly"". When was the last time you met somebody named Beverly? Stuff like ""Bruce"" or ""richard"". These names are perfectly fine, they've just fallen out of fashion for no reason at all.

Names like Burgess, Uriah, Lucille and Alice. There are tons of names from the middle ages and biblical times that are absolutely Metal AF, all of which have perfectly fine shortened nickname versions of themselves. It's crazy how nobody is naming their kids them, like Oziras or Abner or Absalom. Man absalom is like the coolest thing I've ever heard. Dude if somebody walked up to me and was like ""hi, I'm absalom"" I'd be like hey bro, what kingdom do you rule or something.

Or at the very least, we gotta start giving kids with boring names, cool nicknames, like buster, or weevil, or bugsy. Like get weird with it. Make it silly. Just make it stand out from everybody else idk. Just don't name your kid ""Stryghlynne"" or ""Jansleigh"" or something",12,4,0.64,GenZ

1c9yb9b,1713748884.0,How we feeling about the pro gun post?,"As you all would say, I‚Äôll bite.

I‚Äôm shocked how many people here are pro gun. In your replies, please tell me what country you are from. Here we go:

It is a uniquely American phenomenon to believe a weapon is a right. It is not a right. You do not ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a gun. You should be a very special, trained person to even be allowed NEAR a gun. You will not overthrow your government that has missiles and helicopters and masses of police forced with your handguns and semi auto rifles and tacticool gear you bought on Amazon. Source? We are being oppressed every day in America and guns haven‚Äôt helped that. (Homelessness is spiking. A president is on trial for the first time EVER, and he is about to win the presidency. I don‚Äôt see you rioting with your guns and winning? A few of you three stones at the wall on Jan 6, and for all the wrong reasons, and did you win? Did you fight a war? No. You got thrown in jail and laughed at.)

Moreover, I completely respect hunting rifles. It‚Äôs a big country, and hunting is better for the environment and cheap. Hunt away. But do it with a bolt action. You have to take a class and pass a test to drive a car, because cars can kill people. Guns are DESIGNED to kill people. You should be willing to take a test, have a license and use a weapon that is safe, and single fire. You don‚Äôt need a minigum to kill some deer.

Next guns are TERRIBLE for self defense. You will miss. You could hit somebody else. At close range, you might not have time to draw and fire. How many of you have even used a gun for self defense? Maybe a few of you, but waving it around doesn‚Äôt count. That makes YOU the problem. Get a taser. Get some pepper spray. Learn to fight. The only thing you need a gun for is to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù against others with guns. Get rid of all the guns, no reason for other guns.

Next, even if all the above wasn‚Äôt true, how can you possibly ignore the insane amount of children that have died for your toys? Your glorified tasers you‚Äôll never use? 1000 per year? More? You are selfish if you think that guns being ‚Äúcool‚Äù is more important than lives. I love guns. They are so sick. As a kid I had all the air soft guns. Then I realized what they did, and I ditched the hobby. Then my friends died in a shooting, and I realized the game wasn‚Äôt worth it. 

Lastly, guns create a state of paranoia that is uniquely American. Walking around the store worried about the next shooting. Dropping kids off at school worried they‚Äôll be next. My local grocery store got shot up. I worked there for Fs sake. Ten people dead. My coworkers dead. I was never the same. Did any good guys with guns stop them? No they ran and hid. The town was ruined for years. The more paranoid we get, the more guns we buy, the more dangerous it gets, the more paranoid we get, it repeats. 

Ask yourself, is it worth it? 


Go ahead, rip me apart. I dont care anymore.


Edit: I do know that guns are a right in America. I am an American. I just do not like the fact that they are and think it‚Äôs silly to call them such.

1c8bhwl,1713569952.0,I don‚Äôt understand the hate for sex scenes in movies,"This is not just address to the recently made post, but I‚Äôve seen several posts about this across Reddit and in this sub. A size-able amount of people on this site seem to dislike and even want to outright ban sex scenes in movies. These aren‚Äôt pre-teen children or religious Gen-X or boomers saying this; they‚Äôre your average young adult internet users, which surprises me.

Didn‚Äôt we, along with the previous generation, grow up to buck against censorship, puritanism and just purity culture in general? I understand that there‚Äôs media that exists out there that is gratuitous with its  use of sex and nudity (which can be annoying), but we‚Äôre all adults right? We understand that this is just art? And art is sometimes things you like and dislike?

I don‚Äôt think anyone should be forced to watch anything they‚Äôre uncomfortable with. If you don‚Äôt like it then by all means avoid it. However, like I said, a considerable amount of people say that this stuff should be banned in media all together. The arguments for doing so don‚Äôt make much sense to me and can be pretty much used against everything in media.

‚ÄúThis is irrelevant to the story, unnecessary and not needed.‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis could‚Äôve been implied instead of shown.‚Äù
These arguments can be used for any action scenes, emotional scenes, violent scenes etc. Fighting scenes aren‚Äôt really necessary and can be implied, high-speed chases aren‚Äôt necessary and can be implied, so on and so forth. I think people forget that what is necessary to a piece of art or media is up to the interpretation of the artist AND audience(s). They also forget that human sexuality can be pretty artistic itself.

The thing I find the most wild is people that connect being okay with sex scenes or liking them to somehow being a porn addict? I think if your mind jumps to this conclusion, you probably have a pretty unhealthy relationship with sex or have some deep insecurities you‚Äôre projecting.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: Thank you for all the discussion on the post y‚Äôall! I appreciate it. I‚Äôve noticed a few things from all the responses so far though:

1. I feel like a lot of people that commented only read the title or didn‚Äôt fully understand the post. I know why sex in media might make some people uncomfortable, I just don‚Äôt understand why sex seems to be singled out in this aspect when people‚Äôs complains can logically be applied to everything else in a movie, therefore having it cut out. But I don‚Äôt nearly see the same level of outrage about over the top gore or action as I do sex

2. A lot of you guys commenting are VERY young, much younger than I expected. When a lot of the responses have reasons such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want things to be awkward with my family‚Äù, this indicates that a lot of people that hold this opinion probably aren‚Äôt any older than 17 years old. This kinda says a lot as to why I‚Äôm getting the kind responses to this post that I‚Äôm seeing. I am about to be 26 for reference.

3. A lot of people are saying things like, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unnecessary‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt advance the plot‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lazy‚Äù and so on. On top of what I said about those sentiments being able to be applied to literally any other aspect in a movie, it also shows a failure to understand art and how some people can value things in different ways than you. What is necessary, advances the plot, and is lazy are things that are entirely subjective not only to the audience; BUT the person making the film or piece of art in the first place. Like I said though, the age of people in the responses and the inability to see other perspectives is probably at play here.",953,477,0.68,GenZ

I haven't had a real friend since 2014-2019 when I went to Four Oaks, and even then we weren't able to communicate outside of Four Oaks and we haven't seen each other since 2019.

I rarely see friends from high school around town, but I'm never able to socialize with them.

There's a girl at school I have a crush on, but I can tell she's not interested. I've never had these kinds of feelings until recently, and I'm not interested in a serious relationship, yet I still want a girl I can hang out with and cuddle sometimes. Sex would be nice.
Is that what a friend-with-benefits is? I don't know. :( Please don't hate me, I really don't know what I'm looking for.
Yes I'm a virgin if you can't tell, which bothers me.

After I turned 19 I joined the military so I couldn't go Home, and after I got out I had contract work so I couldn't go home. This is the first year I went back home since I was 18 during the holidays for work (I'm 26/27 birthday month) and MANNNNNN this year was depressing AF 

I went to the Old folks home, we where the only ones to go. It was my immediate family only. When walking back and forth from my Grandpas room and the eating hall I heard so many depressing conversations.

Some people had no one to begin with.

Before I would just walk up to a girl, ask if she wants to talk and flirt. But now I get super short responses and no one wants to engage in conversations. 

Before Covid, I could say, ""hey I like your tattoos. Do they mean anything"" but now I can only get to ""hey I like your tattoos..."" Then they cut me off and move on. 

I'm in no way a Barney Stinson but I haven't gotten a single good conversation, let alone a date since the end of Covid. I'm approaching but everything just seems different now.

I was a junior in high school when lockdown hit in my state of Ohio. As you can imagine, my senior year of high school was spent in a mess of online classes and not knowing what the future looked like. I didn‚Äôt have a whole lot of academic help at home like I did at school, so my previously decently upkept grades plummeted and it feels like I‚Äôve struggled heavily with motivation and life participation in general since (well except for the 8 months post-lockdown where I temporarily moved away from home and found things much easier to cope with. But that‚Äôs a whole other complicated story. 

Anyway, I won‚Äôt get too deep into playing my violin over any of that, since we‚Äôre all dealing with it. But in a lot of ways it feels like lockdown never ended. It feels like everything (people) are a million miles away and I‚Äôm afraid to connect for fear of rejection. I know it‚Äôs stupid, and I hate that I‚Äôve let myself get to this point. But In many ways the more I‚Äôve moved into adulthood the more I feel like I need to find some way to get closure for my childhood since it never got its own proper ending. Idk. Do any other Gen-z that are around my age have tips for dealing with this? I just need to find some possible way to show my brain that it‚Äôs childhood is over and it needs to move onto adulthood. The whole process of doing that got interrupted in March of 2020 and I haven‚Äôt recovered, much to my own shame. 

ETA: not that it‚Äôs important for the *general* topic at hand, but it is important for how it relates to me. I was diagnosed with ADHD in the first grade and I come from alcoholics who weren‚Äôt always the greatest at guidance despite having lots and lots of love in their hearts. So without my teachers that last year and 1/3 of high school, I was just lost. And the ADHD and parents thing is why I feel like I always would‚Äôve been lost in adulthood to some degree, but I think the pandemic made my issues relating to that 10x worse. 

ETAx2: I probably shouldn‚Äôt have added that because it‚Äôs not particularly relevant. But deleting it after adding it feels like the wrong thing to do. So the ‚ÄúETA‚Äù is here now but feel free to ignore it if you‚Äôd like to. ",120,118,0.94,GenZ

1c7t5l1,1713521183.0,"No, overpopulation isn't the problem and immigration won't fix declining fertility rates - a response to my previous post    ","I got a lot of responses to [my previous post about declining fertility rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/s/BxrqqW8HEF) about how immigration will fix this and there's too much people and we hurt the environment. 

1. Immigration won't fix declining fertility rates. Most countries will reach fertility rates below the replacement level of 2.2 kids per woman by 2100. The only way this would work is the rich countries keeping Africa, Asia, South America and Oceania poor so the educated would emigrate to rich countries and start a new life. Kind of an immoral thing to do.   

#2. There's not too much people, but a waaay too big missalocation of resources between the rich and poor. The myth of overpopulation is killing us. 

Let me introduce you to the [Global North and Global South divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_North_and_Global_South?wprov=sfla1). 

#People in the Global North, AKA blue countries, consume too much resources, energy and contribute the most to climate change and climate related disasters, ecosystem collapse and mass extinction and topsoil loss and bear the smallest brunt of them, while those in the Global South AKA the red countries, consume too little resources and energy, causing poverty and deprivation and contribute the least to climate change related disasters and the biggest brunt of ecosystem collapse and mass extinction and topsoil loss while bearing the biggest brunt of them.   

We can easily maintain 8 billion people or even 12 billion, the projected world population by 2100 if we reduce our overconsumption of energy and resources as well as our brunt on the environment, not just emissions, and spread energy,  resources, the environment and wealth more equally. 

#We can't maintain 8 billion people or 12 billion people if everyone consumes the same as an average American, German or Australian. 

#If everyone lives and consumes the same as an average person in the Global North, we'd need 5 planets, and we only have 1. We need to radically reduce our overconsumption of energy, resources and our brunt on the environment, not just emissions.                                                      

If you think overpopulation is the problem, I've got an ideology for you. It should scare you. It's called [Ecofascism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecofascism). It believes climate change, ecosystem collapse, mass extinction and other environmental problems are caused by overpopulation, especially by those poor people. They want to eliminate most of the poor.    

The world population will reach 12 billion people in 2100 and then level off or fall down.          ",216,174,0.74,GenZ

here are some reasons why texas is the best state (if you didn't already know and you somehow need convincing)

1. texas is big

go big or go home? we always go big. even if we did go home, we would still be in texas. largest state in the lower 48, you could drive from maine to south carolina in the same distance it takes to go to texas. beat that, california.

2.  diversity

texas is literally one of the most diverse states in the lower 48 and accurately represents the demographics of the US population. all the people saying texas is full of old white men have literally never been to texas. especially if you go to the cities. i would spontaneously combust if the demographics of my school changed significantly. theres a reason that i want to go to *Brown* University.

3. food

this is the most important reason on this list. every cuisine in the world, texas has. if i want to get banging indian food, there's a whole district for that. if i want to shop at the chinese market, there's a district for that too. and tex mex? i tried tex mex in the north once. y'all don't even know what tex mex is. Please, come to texas just to try the tex mex. We also have the best brisket and BBQ in the country. also whataburger > in n out. bucees and gas stations that are one stop shops during road trips.

 also chick fil a. i could not imagine living in a state with less then 100 chick fil as. they're literally on like every street corner here. we have over 3 times as many as california, at 460 for the most of any US state. chick fil a for the win.

4. less open antisemitism.

5. texas history

we were our OWN country for a while (not some fake ass republic that lasted like 25 days), and we had cowboys.

6. pop culture

we're literally famous for cowboys and the wild west and rodeos and horse riding. there are so many songs dedicated to texas and texas is probably the state with the most recognition outside of the US bc we're just that cool. our state literally is the best in the universe!

7. driving

driving on highways in texas will make sure that you're prepared for driving anywhere in the us. my californian cousin was literally complaining about the roads the whole time and going at some slow ass crawl speed, when i've been accustomed to the texas way literally from the moment i popped out the womb. also you have great majestic feats like the Katy freeway and the high five interchange

texas produces the MOST renewable energy of any states, and its not close.

9. niceness and language

texan hospitality is a thing. yes, people are loud and brash. but they're friendly. like going from texas to any other state and back, its literally like day and night how people are. like in texas they'll ask you how your day has been or say good morning to you as you're walking past, and people are just really hospitable. also y'all. Y'all'd'n'tve, y'all'd've, y'all'd, y'all'd'a all hold special places in my heart.

1c8ypnv,1713642448.0,I cheated on my online boyfriend because I didn't know how real the relationship was.  I regret this so much,"My whole life I couldn't fathom cheating.  It seemed like the cowards way out, a betrayal that only awful people would do.  Maybe that's true and I've become that person.

A while back I met a guy on an online game.  We started to play together and eventually talked more and more, only through text.  Once I found out he was into guys, I told him I was too and we soon started flirting.  I think I was 21 and he was 20.  Neither of us had been in a relationship before.

We eventually agreed to be boyfriends.  We knew it'd be hard because he was from South America, and me from North America.  I also had a lot of trust issues early on.  Like whether he was being honest about things like his age, life, etc.  And we showed a couple pictures of ourselves but never shared our voice until way later on.

He was amazing to me with his words and thoughts, it was a cute time.  I feel bad looking back on it because he was very sweet.  I think I felt so unsure of our relationship and how real it was.  I didn't even know his name.  But I should have communicated these feelings I had about it.  Instead I was a coward and would talk to other guys on the apps to get a flirting/sexting fix.  While still keeping my fantasy land online boyfriend.  I acted terribly and whether our relationship was real or not, I still feel like it was cheating and I feel awful.  Especially because I still talk to the guy.  We agreed to be friends and game together.  This is such an ugly part of my life, I've felt awful for a long time for it.

Another difficult thing was I would tell him ""we're so young, if someone comes into your life locally and you want to pursue something, I understand."".  And I think me saying that made him feel like we'd never work out.  I was just scared of us wasting our youth on an impossible love.  It was also hard because he'd go days without talking to me.  We had our own lives to tend to on top of this relationship we were trying to make work.  But the days apart from him made me feel so insecure about our relationship.  It made me feel like he didn't want to talk to me.  Overall I think this was not a healthy way to go about dating somebody, and I have a lot to learn about respecting others.",7,0,0.23,GenZ

1c7iri4,1713484865.0,The government should encourage a healthy lifestyle/diet,"I‚Äôve thought about this a lot. It really bothers me how the government does absolutely nothing (or close to nothing) to incentivise healthy living.  

A healthy person is a stronger, smarter, kinder one. If most people in society were as such, said society itself would be stronger, smarter and kinder. Yet, the government seems to completely neglect that.  

I believe that just like how the government has agencies and regulations that ensure meat and other ingredients are properly transported/hygienic (and they force this on restaurants/stores), the government should have agencies that evaluate a restaurants‚Äô ‚Äúhealthiness‚Äù.  

Things such as nutrition, calories, macros, micros, protein and etc. would be accounted for.  

No current restaurant would be prohibited or banned, but the worse your food health is, the higher its taxed (much like cigarettes), and the more healthy it is, the higher it is incentivised (reverse taxed?).  

Examples (for easier comprehension):  

- McDonalds : Every article (except maybe salads) has a 50-100% tax.  

- Dairy Queen : 80-150% tax.  

- Steak Restaurants : 20-30% tax.  

- Fresh vegetables in grocery stores: 30-40% paid by government.  

- Meat/etc in grocery stores: 25-35% paid by government.  

These are examples. The point is that the vegetables and other healthy options price decrease will be partially paid by the extra tax from the unhealthy options.

*""Lying flat""* is a movement that originated from China, also known as ""tang ping"" in response to  the *996 work culture, involving working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week*. This is where one chooses to ""lie down flat and get over the beatings"" by pursuing a low-desire, more indifferent attitude towards life. We generally refer to this as a minimalist lifestyle.

*BaristaFIRE* is where the returns from your invested assets cover most, but not all of your living expenses, and you do work that you find enjoyable to make up for the difference and fund the rest of your lifestyle.

*CoastFIRE* is where you minimize your spending and invest as much as possible until you reach a target amount of savings that lets you ‚Äúcoast‚Äù toward an eventual retirement in your 60s. The ‚Äúcoast‚Äù part means that you keep working after you attain your target savings amount.

But it feels uncomfortable that they say that, for example, people aged 24-27 have more in common with people aged 50-55 than with people aged 20-21, just because at 20-21 one is still studying college and at 24-27 one is already working (recently working), and since someone who is 50+ yo is also working, they say that those who are 25 and 50 have more things in common.

In my case, It's as if they want to say that by finishing college, a year difference is very significant. Older people exaggerate, hoping that someone will skip 5 years or more in less than a month. Or because you turned 18 they expect too much than when you were 17.

Obviously I know the fact that someone at 50-55 is way different than someone at 24-27 for the reason that the first ones have more experience working while the second ones are just starting. I don't connect at all with people who are 20-30 years older than me, it's too much, ten years ago I was 14 and they around 45, during our adolescence, social networks grew and in-person interaction was disappearing, while in theirs, they had to work at a very young age and very few of them attended high school.

1c88aqr,1713561638.0,Joining the Military was the Best Decision of my Life," To start off, this post may come off as some recruitment propaganda but it's not. Just some dude who started getting posts from here in his feed for the last 2 months. I see the shit that you guys deal with what seems to be on a daily basis and I couldn‚Äôt even imagine facing those situations right now.

Joined the Air Force during Covid because I wanted to start living life on my own/travel/start doing adult shit basically and enlisted. Now I'm some years in, going to college (for free btw) and really getting set up to have a career outside the military. I understand the military isn't for everyone, the stress of leaving home and or being held to some weird standards really does put a toll on people sometimes. Personally I really wanted it and it actually removed a lot of stress from my life lol. 

I just thought I should come on here and enlighten you all on some opportunities to escape the hell holes some of you seem to live in. 

1. We aren‚Äôt all killers - For the majority of us, it is literally just a job. For example, the majority of the Air Force fills some sort of admin position, not bombing or shooting shit.
2. Much more inclusive than before - I can‚Äôt speak for all branches on this, but I do feel the Air Force and Army at least. Any sort of illegal discrimination is an absolute no-no, people caught doing that will be destroyed so quick. The way I see it, it's as if you can get in trouble at work for being an asshole outside of it.
3. New family - We are all friends unless you're a bad person. I could sit there and bs with almost anyone in my unit. Cliques do form up but it's not like they aren't willing to be your friend
4. Basically guaranteed pay - I've never seem someone lose pay, but I've heard of people who have and they did some unusually fucked up things
5. Really forces you to self develop - I've learned how to really care for myself from joining. A lot of what seems to be bs you‚Äôll find out later is actually really nice. For example, making the bed. I love having a made bed when I get home to wrap up cozy in. Another example, Physical Training (PT). Getting paid to be fit? Hell yeah.

As a 19yo who was scared of signing away to a college and getting locked into a degree I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy, joining the military was the best decision I could have made. I got to experience life and see what a majority of jobs I was interested in really do. I Just finished my AA and hope to be very close to finishing my bachelors before I separate. Got some job experience in a field that really grew on me, and although it feels like I'm starting my life of making real money a little late, it's better than hating every aspect of my life.

Again, not a recruiter here. Just some other dumbass who feels like they made 1 good decision.

I recall in my teenage years having a great time playing games on my Xbox 360 and for all I know there could have been people older than me who thought those games were trash and I never would have known.

Affordability of homes in the US has become an enormous issue. Many of my peers (I'm in the younger half of millennials) have totally given up on the dream of homeownership because they don't think they will ever be able to afford it. We created Joy to help solve the affordability problem in the US.

Joy is a real estate agent, exclusively working with homebuyers. Joy can do anything a standard real estate agent can do (except meet in-person). She can schedule viewings, negotiate offers, coordinate inspections, ETC.

The best part about Joy is that she rebates 70% of her commission earned back to the homebuyer.

Example of how Joy works:

  
\- Homebuyer uses Joy to buy a $500,000 home  
\- Joy receives a 3% commission on this transaction, which is equal to $15,000  
\- Joy rebates 70% of this commission back to the homebuyer, equal to $10,500

  
The homebuyer can receive this rebate payment as cash, put it towards their down payment or buy down interest points to lower their monthly mortgage payment.

We have a 100 second intro video to Joy that you can find here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMxXAZdP5YA&t=32s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMxXAZdP5YA&t=32s)

Violent crime hit a low point in 2014. But in 2015, it started drifting up again, and in 2020 it absolutely spiked. Many feared that America was entering a long-term period of elevated urban violence, like we did in the 1970s. But starting in 2022, something good started to happen ‚Äî violence started to fall. It fell even more in 2023

**We‚Äôre making progress against climate change**

Green technologies have gotten cheaper at astounding rates, to the point where decarbonization is the smart economic option as well as the good environmental choice. At the same time, economic growth is generally shifting from manufacturing to services, especially online services, which are less carbon-intensive. As a result, emissions have been falling in the developed world, and decelerating across much of the developing world


**The U.S. economy is growing pretty fast**

When you look at international comparisons, America is actually doing really well. Most countries have struggled to grow at pre-pandemic rates in the post-pandemic era ‚Äî this is especially true of European countries that suffered from the Russian gas cutoff, but it‚Äôs also true of places like Japan and Canada (and even China). The U.S. has powered ahead, even when you take higher immigration rates into account. 


**Younger generations are doing better than their parents**

In the 2010s, there was a big worry that the Millennial generation, and perhaps also Generation Z, would be uniquely hurt by the financial crisis and by other negative economic trends. But in the years since the pandemic, it‚Äôs become apparent that younger generations are ‚Äî on average ‚Äî doing very well economically.

1c7jb2w,1713486381.0,"Pokemon go unites all gen z imo as this was our universal ""you just had to be there"" moment","Here is why I think pokemon go is the universal gen z experience. Pokemon go I feel like was marketed towards teens/tweens (people who would prolly have a phone and be able to walk around but also have enough to time to waste walking around collecting pokemon)  I feel like that vast majority were young adults and kids. early 20 year olds were the oldest demographic that realistically would enjoy this and have enough time to be out and about collecting pokemon (considering most of them would have been walking around a lot during college) and kids around 6 were the youngest kids who could walk and understand how to play pokemon go. Because of that I feel like during the pokemon go crazy its mostly anyone who was ealry 20s or younger but could walk. This also would perfectly describe gen z cause the people who would have fit being 22-5 were literally the oldest genz/ zilliennials-the youngest gen z. I asked my younger z cousins who would have been 8 &7 at the time and they both remember playing pokemon go and the crazy in general (like the remember the whole event not just playing it, from masses of people trying to catch mew and other pokemon at the raids to the news stories of accidental deaths from not paying attention)

I feel like this is on those you just had to be there moments and all of gen z (for the most part) was there. Idk if this makes sense but the reason I thought of this is because every ""stage"" of gen z has their own personal you just had to be their moments.  the early gen z has vine from beginning to death, middle or ""core"" gen z has being a covid teen, late gen z has tiktok. but the difference between the ones mentioned and pokemon go is that like you had to be a teen to earliest like tween to fully experience them.

Some other events that I also feel are universal to gen z. (from most ""universal"" after pokemon to least imo)

-harambe/harambe memes (2016)

* avengers infinity war and end game (2018-2019)

I got into an argument with someone who said my parents were shitheads for planning and giving birth to me when they were poor. For reference, this is America in the 90s/00s era and I'm the firstborn.

I ended up asking my dad why they did that. My dad is a refugee who grew up in an extremely rural and backwoods parts of an underdeveloped country. He said he didn't really *feel* super poor and that though they didn't have a lot of money, I was still going to be fed, clothed, sheltered and loved (even if everything was from the thrift) so it wasn't a tough decision for him to have kids at that stage. Because he was starved, unclothed, unsheltered, and was forced to leave his family as a child.

As a kid, I felt the effects of being poor, but 90% of it was just being jealous of my friends who had more materialistic items than me. Looking back, I had a happy childhood despite living in a 2bd apt with 10 people. But of course you can't *know* if your child is going to be happy so it's all based on hindsight.

Even in my post history in GenZ, I mentioned my son is GenZ, not me. I have never pretended to be GenZ myself and make that pretty clear.

I was just accused of astroturfing because I am a millennial and discussing the impact of policies on my health and I was discussing the impact of those policies on my own GenZ son.  
When we lost out home, my GenZ son lost his home as well. When I almost died, he almost lost his mom.  The $400k in hospital bills, those are some of his hospital bills as well. The $3000 in medicine expenses are the combination of both his and my medication. I feel that these issues  are just as important to GenZ as they are to millennials. These issues impact every aspect of my GenZ son's life as well, so think it is worthy of discussion.

1c6s6yx,1713406859.0,Tik Tok is not good.,"I never used it until just recently since I have a fitness page on Instagram and I wanted to branch out to other platforms. 

I have quickly realised that a lot of the content on there is really borderline pornographic. As soon as I downloaded the app and scrolled through the stuff that‚Äôs there (stuff I hadn‚Äôt searched for or anything) I saw video after video of people in suggestive situations doing questionable dances/skits... Again, stuff that I had only just downloaded the app and saw.

I never engage in that stuff, I don‚Äôt even use the app other than to post videos straight from my Instagram. I was appalled to see this.

Tbh I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see some of the stuff on there so upfront and in plain sight. The app is heavily used by young kids and it doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.

Some of the ‚Äútrends‚Äù you hear about too are really nasty considering what they consist of, and the audience watching. 

I know of somebody who‚Äôs 9 year old daughter got in trouble at school because she was doing the WAP dance for a Tik Tok. That‚Äôs a 9 year old girl doing the Wet Ass Pussy dance for ANYBODY to see.

That‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve heard of minors/underage children getting in trouble for the content they put out on there. It is a parenting issue as well, you should know what your kids are up to.

Look, I‚Äôm all for expressing yourself and being free to post what you want as long as it follows the guidelines. But many people on that platform push the boundaries too far and blur the line between entertainment and adult content. 

We aren‚Äôt stupid, we know what they‚Äôre doing and they know what they‚Äôre doing when filming. All angles used, trending sounds, clothing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all intentional and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs good when you get people like the 9 year old girl who don‚Äôt know better and wanna copy.

Yes the parents need to do better, but so do content creators, knowing who the audience are on the platform.

I don‚Äôt know what can be done to fix this, it seems that for the most part the app is okay but it can also be a pedophiles playground and that shouldn‚Äôt sit right with anybody.

1c7bqxl,1713467523.0,"Ok but like... Gen Alpha content is worse, no?","At this point the ""Gen Alpha brain rot"" meme has become a little oversaturated, as I think we can all admit looking back that our childhoods weren't exactly filled with the pinnacle of intellectual thought either, but like... things have gotten worse, no?

I know nostalgia plays a large role in it, but if we turn off the needless generational warfare and nostalgia goggles, it's pretty bad, and I don't even think its Gen Alpha's fault either. I know we're the first generation to have grown up online, but Gen Alpha is really the first generation to be weened on algorithms and its been that way for a while. Elsagate was becoming a problem as far back as 2016 and more recently content farms on YouTube have once again started to proliferate to an insane degree. Since around then, the Jake Paul tier sludge of the content mill has only gotten worse and found new ways to seep into every level of kids entertainment.

Back in my day (God I feel old), even if things like *Fred* and *Annoying Orange* were kinda sugary and hyperactive, they still don't have that same hyper processed addictive feel of this new wave of content. They still were the work of one person or a small group of people that started making the content cause they thought it was funny. Sure Smosh or early PewDiePie weren't high brow content, but we didn't have anything quite on the level of the content farms or Cocomelon. There are growing movements in government to regulate [content like this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/02/children-safety-social-media-california/) and increased interest in studying the effect that parenting via these hyperactive programs can have on a kids development.

So with all that in mind, do we really just have rose-tinted glasses on or is there maybe some legs to the concern levied at Gen Alpha-centric content?

Given Gen Z‚Äôs approach towards mental health, do you think a major characteristic of Gen Z parenting will be high monitoring on our children‚Äôs mental health? Examples include putting kids through several screenings, being more concerned on what mental conditions their kid might have, and more kids going receiving some sort of treatment whether it be therapy or medications.

For starters, housing costs tens of times your entire yearly salary.

The more family friendly, bigger, walkable, older [commie blocks](https://poznan.nieruchomosci-online.pl/mieszkanie-w-bloku-mieszkalnym,do-odswiezenia/24886058.html) sell at hundreds of thousands. It's hard to justify having kids when you can't afford your own roof over your head.   

If you and your child get sick, you either wait [YEARS to visit the doctor](http://www.korektorzdrowia.pl/en/news/4-year-queue-see-a-specialist/) or you spend half your salary on private treatment. It's even worse when it comes to [mental help](https://notesfrompoland.com/2020/05/01/stigmatisation-and-medication-polands-outdated-approach-to-mental-health/). Or you could just die, who cares xD. 

You can't find a good job. Either you work in a Januszex where labor laws aren't respected, overtime is unpaid and you often work without a contract of employment or you work under a junk contract. Or you overwork yourself to death in a corpo.    

Public transportation is shitty and pretty much nonexistent outside major cities. Wanna have kids in the country? Too bad, buy a car or get crammed into private busses older than your parents or just move to a city lol. [Bus lines are disappearing](https://ibb.co/XFcqBgV), just like [train lines](https://ibb.co/TLgT683).

If you want your child to go to nursery and kindergarten, then wait 300 places in line, or spend even more on private nursery. 

If you want your child to be educated, too bad. He'll have to memorize shittons of unnecessary stuff and be bullied by teachers and students, when he reports that he'll be blamed too. Stress, depression, burnout and so on guaranteed. It's even worse when you go to college.          

If your fetus has some complications that threaten its and even your life, too bad. I hope you have a couple kilos for a trip to Slovakia or Czechia (but you probably don't).           

And climate change, ecosystem collapse, capitalism and new technologies like AI and biotech. They all make future look grim and hopeless.

Parents are also exhausted by societal expectations. Women are expected to be independent and work, while still taking care of the kids. Fathers share housework and childcare more equally, but are still expected to mostly work and be the family's main income.  

Why is this a problem?   

#Because our modern elderly pension funds and socioeconomic systems rely on working adults being the majority. If they don't, the system dies. 

They require constant population growth or at least staying the same. If you can't have that, you need a demographic peak once a few generations.    

More old people means skyrocketing healthcare and elder care costs. Working adults would have to work even more for less. The financial burden would be insane. 

Those older people would also elect people who favor them and wealth over climate change mitigation, cost of living crisis mitigation and other leftist policies.    

We need massive public housing programs, free and universal childcare, healthcare, education and transportation as well as financial incentives for parents and better wages and 4 hour work days and 4 day work weeks.

 basically, we are in second year of uni and only met this year, through one of my housemates. we have become really close and he practically lives at my house, as he is friends with all of my housemates as well. we basically just have become super close, and i realised i think i like him as more than a friend recently. however, i dont want to ruin our friendship and dont know how he feels so have not said anything to practically anyone about my feelings. since we are so close, we are each other's number one best friends on snapchat, (very juvenile i know but we have the red heart), text all the time, hangout one on one and do couple like stuff all the time. recently we got quite drunk at a friends house and he got into bed with me and fell asleep spooning me. however a friend of mine said she asked him and he said he would never be more than friends with me. but his actions just sometimes contradict this, e.g. very touchy with me, i always catch him looking at me and smiling even in group settings, and there just is that vibe. a lot of people also notice this and comment but we both havent addressed it to each other. he also talks to me about girls, and i do the same about guys. anyways i guess im wondering is it normal for guys to behave this way around girls they genuinely have no interest in beyond normal friendship, or do u think he could have feelings for me?? also a year before we even met and became friends we realised we matched on hinge and talked for a bit not sure thats relevant but hahah. however i know im not his 'type', im tall, blonde, he is into short brunettes. theres more stuff i could go into detail about but this is just a rambly summary.

also, ive never had a super close 'platonic' relationship with a guy before so maybe im just overthinking what actually is just normal friendly behaviour.

i feel like at our age there is so much nuance around guy/girl friendships esp with texting/social media. is it possible to even have a complete platonic guy/girl friendship???",5,3,1.0,GenZ

Someone showed me yesterday a short clip on X of a high school student slapping a female teacher twice.  
To my horror he kept scrolling and it was one after another of high school males assaulting teachers. 
If it wasn‚Äôt a teacher it was a high school male punching or slapping a female student.  There is no need to provide examples of it, I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone has seen what I‚Äôve seen- and I really don‚Äôt want to see them again. So..

When did this start happening? Why does this happen ? Why do these kids think this is ok?  And most importantly what is to blame for this behavior?  My wife who works with special needs kids so she is somewhat connected to today‚Äôs teens thinks that because of smart phones.  She says kids  are losing the ability to ‚Äúuse their words‚Äù. She said they act impulsively and don‚Äôt understand how to diffuse situations with words. They speak to  people with the same sarcastic manner as you normally see online except in person there usually are consequences. Mike Tyson also spoke of this. 

I am calling BS on that. I blame my generation of parenting.  My mom would have beaten the holy shyt out of me for raising a hand to a teacher or female student and then my dad would have had a turn.  Knowing that would be in my future kept me from acting like that.  Instead of that my generation of parents gives out participation trophy‚Äôs , put helmets & knee pads & elbow pads on kids to ride a bike, and blame everyone else if their kids is an entitled POS. Again, I blame my generation of parents and lawmakers.  Sadly that type of parenting is frowned upon now. 

The third opinion I heard is social media.  Basically ‚Äúmonkey see -monkey do‚Äù. 

So what is the biggest contributing factor to this behavior.  And please understand that I know this is a small percentage of teens that engage in this behavior and it certainly isn‚Äôt an attack on your generation, and  maybe I am still in shock from what I saw‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. but holy shyt wtf is going on?

False. Malnutrition doesn't make you strong. Being bullied doesn't make you strong - it makes you traumatized - it puts you at risk of becoming irrational and growing up to be the next bully. Overcoming this requires an environment that's safe enough for you to self-reflect without interruption from haters that call you a pussy for re-gaining your empathy.

Strength doesn't come from being forced into relentless repetitive hardship.

Strength comes from freely choosing new challenges and pursuing them with plenty of rest & nutrition along the way.

*"" Zoomers are perceived to have a work ethic that‚Äôs considerably lower than previous generations and are labeled difficult to work with.""\**

*"" So, what can modern organizations do to get ahead of the compound challenges of retaining, engaging, and motivating a generation that, according to the data, is disloyal, disengaged, and lacking motivation? ""*

When will boomers admit that their policies that they put in place, did nothing but benifit themselves and now they are sucking the life out of the economy (aside from usual inflation) because they strained the capacity of public education, postsecondary education, the labor market, and the housing market. Today, they are the largest cohort in the labor force. As Boomers exit the workforce, they will strain the Social Security system. They were greedy with the economy and got the upper hand on all generations after. 

OF COURSE GEN Z IS ANGRY. We get told we are lazy and failures but you can't live off off anything less than 13$ in a small town and nothing under 18$ an hour in major cities (without children!). Someone told me the other day ""well I worked minimum wage and was able to support my family, you just need to be willing to make sacrifices"" THATS NOT EVEN POSSIBLE NOW. Getting an education puts you thousands in debt  if you decide to go any university. The average age of moving out of parent house is now 25-28. And there are not enough children being born to replace the previous generation because you can't even afford to take care of yourself anymore. But while boomers sit in their house they bought for 100-150k, they tell gen z they are failures for not buying a 300k house at 18 years old. So many people are on unemployment and have been actively applying for jobs for several months but never gets a call back. Everyone I know and myself tries so hard to just live paycheck to paycheck and it's SAD. Gen Z may be rude and angry, but boomers are greedy and judgemental.

1c6mrsw,1713391812.0,Dating Culture WTF,"I was scrolling through my feed today and there was a reddit post about if nobody asks each other out anymore and I wanted to give some thoughts for discussion. 

I am a 31 year old pansexual millennial and I was not able to date at all because of religious parents restricting bodily autonomy and privacy due to purity culture and stagnant wages and high cost of living. Then I lived through #metoo which created and compounded the weird culture of concealment around dating and Sexuality where everybody seemed to be paranoid and on edge that any person might be ""creepy"" or ""needy"" or ""desperate"" or a harasser or secretly a rapist or something, which basically just caused me to self sabotage and have panic attacks avoiding dating at all because I wasn't able to support a long term relationship anyways. 

So anyways I was reading this subreddit post on this topic and people are asking why young people aren't asking each other out anymore and it looks like the Gen z guys are saying they are too afraid to for the same reasons and the Gen z girls are saying older guys hitting on them is still creepy or annoying because it feels like ""their dad"" is hitting on them. 

So... let me get this straight. When you are young and can't afford to support a long term relationship, that's not going to work and you are controlled by purity culture and nobody wants to settle down because they see marriage as oppressive. But then once you can afford a long term relationship then it becomes ""creepy"" and a #metoo violation because you are like ""their dad"" (wtf as a millennial if I'm like the dad of anybody in Gen z that means I would have had to have had a kid at like 10 years old).

What is going on with you guys for real 

I think as a millennial of 31 I lived through both purity culture and the #metoo movement which basically created a cultural paranoia and culture of Concealment around dating which benefits the most dishonest rapey people while leaving people who are trying to take things seriously kind of screwed over having panic attacks to not be seen as a harasser or whatever for hitting on women. This was a concern especially in the Workplace where women would be complaining about Workplace Harassment. But usually what I'm seeing is most people spend most of their adult lives in the Workplace with physical third places becoming rarer and rarer (especially ones that don't cost alot of money). So realistically wtf are you supposed to do exactly? Get a therapist? Get a dog? Go on dating apps? Lol riiighht

So now I'm single and 31 and definitely just stopped caring what age gaps there are as long as there is consent 

Another thing I've found is that as a guy using Hinge or Tinder or Bumble has been a total disaster but if I use grindr I get a ton of people initiating Conversations with me and wanting to actually go out, have long conversations that don't just end up with ghosting, and hook up with the potential for longer term connection - even with women. Why is it easier to date as a lgbtq person than as a cis guy? Another thing is that women and guys with age gaps seem to not really care on grindr while on the conventional apps people seem to be extremely paranoid

In my opinion if women don't like age gaps and think it's creepy they are going to need to start express true gender equality by taking the lead and initiating sometimes both in person and in the bedroom otherwise to find somebody that meets their expectations (good job, extremely confident with no fks given attitude, is experienced enough how to navigate this late stage capitalist hellscape, can entertain them and take them out, is good in bed, has a power disparity to easily lead them, and so on) is going to be older by default. I had one experience with a girl who was 28 on Bumble and the minute I started talking about feelings it seemed like she was turned off and like 80% of the women on these apps wants to be led and has a sub fetish and won't be bothered to be with guys who want a more equal arrangement in the bedroom and in person

Anyways I got left behind so anybody who thinks I'm creepy for trying now I really just don't care after all the purity culture and #metoo stuff. I care about consent and respect but if you think I'm not going to try to hit on you and shoot my shot because you are younger sorry but not sorry I definitely am no regrets

EDIT: Also I cannot figure out why women my own age want me to Lead them and initiate and do everything. If they are equal outside of the bedroom I expect the dynamic in the bedroom to be the same, otherwise if they want somebody with that power dynamic they crave there is going to be an Age Gap. They always act bewildered by older guys are hitting on them and they have more Sexual chemistry with older guys but less emotional chemistry. I'm not going to be playing that game, if they want gender equality they can also extend that in the dating sphere and the bedroom. Otherwise there is going to be an Age Gap. If they think it's creepy that older guys are hitting on them I think they should not be looking for dominant guys to take control, they need to be more equal and that includes in taking initiative, making the money, and the Sexual compatibility. As a pansexual person there is NO REASON that dating and hooking up with other guys or Trans people should be 10000% easier. There is literally no excuse. Do you think power dynamics are sexy that usually come with age gaps or are creepy? Is it oppressive for the guy to be leading and controlling things or is it oppressive? Do you want equality or does it annoy you that the guy isn't in charge? Make up your freaking minds and get it together people",15,0,0.35,GenZ
1c54swz,1713234049.0,When we get called lazy for not wanting to suffer for 18 years and 9 months,"Just want to begin by saying I'm not a parent myself, but I was 15 when the oldest of my younger siblings was born so I do know a lot about taking care of kids and how complicated it can be. 

When I was a kid up to when I started living in an appartment at 20, I really wanted kids, but honestly I just don't think it's a realistic goal to have a happy life with kids if you don't make a combined salary of at least 150-200K in your household or if you really really think you'll find pleasure in the simple things of parenthood as a gen z. 

Unless you have not been exposed to social media (which is extremely rare nowadays), expectations of raising kids have increased to the max. I'm not saying some new safety measures and parenting styles aren't a good change, but we're also talking about the picture perfect families sharing everything on social media, the fact that babies have like actual big brand clothes now for some reason, the morman mom's cooking everything from scratch on tiktok - including oreos... ew - to showcase how bad you are personnally handling your life as a mom - everything to make parents feal more and more incapable in their role. 

When I look at my older sister, I can see she tries so hard to give her child all the activities she sees on social media and all so she can get relief for a second of not thinking she's a horrible parent for needing a break from time to time - she's also a single mom, so double the work. 

I get annoyed when people call gen z lazy for not wanting to have kids, but like what do you want us to do? I have an ok salary rn, enough to give me an ok place and take care of a cat, but add a kid to that and boom, now on top of the 40 hours I'm doing for not much, you're telling me I'm going to struggle like never before and not be able to get any time for myself? Oh and also wreck my body for years. Why would anyone want that! Unless you're rich enough to be able to either have one parent stay at home or have a babysitter/cleaning person help with household chores, I just don't see how you'll be able to enjoy much of the joys of parenthood. 

Edit: I just shared one aspect of it. This is conversations I've had with friends and wanted to see if other people my age related to. The reasons stated here are not the only reasons I wouldn't want a child and I don't feel like I have to keep repeating myself on it lol. Find me immature if you want for explaining the economy is bad which makes it harder to have kids... Start reading up on the costs of having a child and you might get where I'm getting at haha

Edit 2: idc about social media myself I'm talking about parent's experience I've heard about. It seems to be an added struggle that is particular to our generation. If you're not a millenial or gen z it might be harder to relate to as you did not grow up with that and that's ok. You may not have friends who struggle with that and that's great.

Turn to each other for advice or when we need to tell someone something we can't discuss with anyone else. We inspire each other to grow in life and we hit the gym everyday. I see only good things in our futures. I was always better at making good decisions and bro was always better at getting girls. We are able to look up to each other in different aspects in life. All our younger friends look up to us. It's good that we can set a positive roll model for others. 

Me and bro definitely not gay. My older brother (1 year older) and his friends always joked about us being gay because how close we were and always hanging out. In my heart I felt that they were jealous because we would push each other to be better, and my older brother would stay stagnant in life, staying in the house, chilling and smoking with his friends, not pushing each other to hit the gym or get money or find better girlfriends. 
But me and bro continued with our mindset. Years later we are in the best positions we've ever been in. and I feel like is because we've always had each others backs. There's been many times in our friendship that situations came up where me and bro would disagree on things but we would still have each others backs. Iron sharpens Iron. Finding a friendship like this doesn't happen all the time. Sacrifices must be made to have something like this. Always tell each other the truth. Say what's on your mind. If you disagree say it, don't hold back your feelings to spare theirs.
 I still love my older brother but often I find my self not being able to tell him how I feel about the things he does to spare his feeling. So I just let him keep doing what he does. I allow him to be complacent and comfortable in the way he lives. My Older brother used to be my best friend, I used to look up to him. But once we reached upperclass men we began to grow apart.
Many people say Blood is thicker than Water. But Mud is thicker than Blood. And me and bro been through the mud together. Shedded blood, sweat, and tears. 
If there's a lesson I could sum up from my post it would be this. ""You are a reflection of the 5 people who hang around the most."" So make sure you keep positive role models in your circle. So you can push each other to grow.

And I know the individual contribution to global carbon emissions are not that big.

For my whole life I've struggled to make friends and maintain friendships. If things are looking good my brain will create a problem and make me want to push myself away from them in order to ""avoid hurt"" as a lot of people grow tired of me since I'm quite a replaceable person.

At this point I don't think I even want friends. My social battery is broken.I can't speak with my parents about very simple things without getting extremely angry and upset and having to leave and I can't have friends because the social responsibility of meeting someone regularly and communicating with them regularly is such a pain. Even if I like a person I always get too burnt out to speak to them and end up pushing them away. If this tiredness and irritation is what having friends is I do not want them. I had 2 friends before I took a break out of school and I've made a conscious effort to push them both away.

I'm literally depressed, a friendless antisocial NEET and all at 17.

What the fuck do I do? I really need to get out of this. I know a part of me wants to contribute to society and make friends but I just can't bring myself to.  I don't think i care about anything other than reading online stories. I'm due to return to sixth form and do a creative course and normally I'd be excited about that but now I'm too depressed to even draw anything new for my porfolio.

So yeah. To give you some context we had broken up before in October after dating since January. The details of the fight are not important but it was because I felt neglected by lack of attention (we have a ldr) and she was being really toxic. 

So we really didn‚Äôt talk until February. She apologized and said she didn‚Äôt want to date and just wanted to be friends (which I was totally happy with).

So we talked and eventually some how she ends up saying she loves me BUT insists that we are just friends. So we end up saying we love each other often. I thought this was a bit weird but it‚Äôs fine and she‚Äôs quirky so it‚Äôs okay.

But eventually she says things like she misses me and we fall asleep on the phone together and end up close again doing normal couple things like saying good night and confiding in each other sleeping on the phone. Whilst I‚Äôm never %100 sure what we are. Until last weekend‚Ä¶

So basically she started talking about some nsfw things and we kinda flirted. Then she introduced me to studio Ghibli (I TOTALLY RECOMMEND BTW) and she picks some songs for me to listen to and asks if I like them. I loved all of them and this one song in particular.

Chipotle- Is expensive for what you get. Though i will be honest, on RARE occasions, i will justify the cost and eat there because the food is still pretty good

McDonald's- Overpriced mess. I would usually get a couple hot n' spicy chicken sandwiches. for 3 dollars. But now they aren't worth it. for 2 now, it's going to be over 6 dollars. It's just not worth it

Wendy's- Not worth it anymore either. Just really highly priced food for no reason. The food is good. But will never be able to justify it's price. Especially since the food is small af.

Subway- over 12 dollars for a freaking basic footlong. I'm sorry but no basic footlong is worth over 12 dollars. I can make a sub at home for far less. The only thing they are good at is their bread, that's it

KFC- Just overrated, overpriced greasy food

The only good fast food place that is actually decent is taco bell. I usually get a couple of rice and bean and cheese burritos. With the chipotle sauce. And now with good avocado sauce they have. It's just slightly over 4 dollars. But it is actually worth it. I usually get cinnamon twists and a medium drink. So it's around 7 usd for me. And it's still worth it",528,1238,0.95,GenZ

Meanwhile, the biggest bully in my elementary school who hit both boys and girls for fun and for gain had a mom who was known to be extremely hands off in her parenting style. According to my parents and the parents of lifelong friends from the same school, the bullies mom would get asked point blank  by other parents at PTA meetings why her kid was such an asshole.

On more than one occasion, she was asked if she ever spanked her child as punishment for hitting others, and she made it vehemently clear that she did not believe in corporal punishment whatsoever.

Is there a reason for this discrepancy in the schools of thought among gen-z, regarding why physicality works against bullies when it comes from peers but not from parents?

And keep in mind, that the conversation is specifically about corporal punishment only in response to a child physically bullying others. Not about corporal punishment for things like bad grades or talking back to an authority figure or other non-physical infractions. ",15,5,0.86,GenZ

1c51oy6,1713225391.0,Are human beings happier in an agrarian lifestyle?,"One of the biggest things about modern society is the loneliness epidemic and the lack of community that people are experiencing. Suicide is very common in developed nations and politics are very fragmented. I spent a lot of time musing on why loneliness, suicide, depression and substance abuse are growing problems and seem to be getting worse each year and only really seems to be a thing in developed nations and then it hit me: technology/national development. The more developed a country becomes the more depressed the society becomes. What you lack in comfort you gain in community, what you lose through community you gain through comfort.

A lot of people blame multiculturalism/ immigration/ ""wokeism"" for all their woes, but look at Japan and South Korea. Both developed, first-world economies and technological titans exceeding far past America. They are both nearly completely ethnically and culturally homogeneous in every way and both nations certainly aren't ""woke"". However, suicide rates are sky-high in both countries. Japan has so many suicides they have a forest famous just for the sheer number of deaths in it. Not to mention the population decline in Japan. Hikokimori, NEET, Laying Down movement are all eastern concepts that are growing in popularity in the west. Not to mention, look at the most popular genre of Japanese manga/anime: isekai. In nearly every isekai, a depressed 25-45 year old average guy hates his life and gains happiness by dying and getting reborn in a medieval agrarian society.

Look at cults, isn't it a coincidence all the common victims of them tend to be wealthy, privileged people who sell their belongings to live in a secluded agrarian commune? Look at the Amish, they don't tend to have as much depression, suicide or general malaise as world around them does. Even Africa tribes don't suffer from depression or suicide at nearly the same rates. To the Hadza tribe of East Africa suicide is unheard of, depression is unheard of. Why does it seem to be the poorest, more agrarian societies that seem to be the happiest, the most jolliest people and seem to have an overabundance of children being born? Meanwhile in developed nation, populations are declining yet depression, suicide and loneliness seems to be rising? It has to be the technology and overall development which is the cause.",21,9,0.77,GenZ

30 years old millenial here. I didnt always have access to the internet, i remember playing mario on my NES on the tv, that was the best i could do to kill time while my parents argued behind my back.

I was 10 when i first got access to internet.

I wonder, when you are growing up with a tablet watching tik tok on multiple screens... How do you even start curbing that addiction?

As in my head its the hardest addiction to beat, technology that was made to be as entertaining as possible to keep attention and engagement, especially when you are born and getting exposed to it right away.

I am 100 percent sure its way harder for people who grew up like that to beat tech addiction, gaming etc. / create healthy boundaries then drug / substance addiction.

But after studying and thinking about it, I've come up with some ideas of my own about some things I'd like to discuss with you here. If you think there is any improvement in my thinking or anything else you would like to say, please let me know and together we can improve and progress.

_____________________________________________

Here is my response to this post:

To be brutally honest, we can certainly complain about some people enjoying the policy dividends of the times or some other things, but the essence of the matter does not lie in the effort or otherwise. Bro, even on the road to success, ""hard work"" is the most basic but also the least important quality. 

Don't easily categorize success with age. There are bums who are old and there are spendthrifts who are young. What is the point? It's CLASS!  Admit it, even if you work hard, there are rich people who can take your wealth without even realizing it. The paycheck you work so hard for is only enough to barely keep you afloat. That's the brutal truth about class that hides behind the generations.

Batman's superpower is ""I'm rich."" Why? Because the entire city of Gotham is owned by Wayne Enterprises, and the wages he pays to the citizens eventually trickle back to him by way of purchases, earning him everyone's labor output in the process. And we as citizens have to listen to people like this preach ""you're lazy and unmotivated and that's why you're not successful""?

Hey bro, congrats on getting ANGRY because you're aggrieved that you're not getting what you deserve for all your hard work because you're finding out about the lies that have been fed to you by the elite and the uninformed. The so-called elites through media, advertisements, and all sorts of means have created a dream for you to become a human being. You suffer because you WAKE UP and have to put yourself back to sleep in order to adapt to the world.
What we need is not to sleep, but to change the world again. 

Gen Z has the ability and the power to do this, and we are destined to be the masters of the world of the future. It's time to make a change, to learn the original logic of how the world works, to change ourselves, to change the world.",11,2,0.63,GenZ

1c5awqu,1713255752.0,USdefaultism and r/GenZ,"Recently this sub seems to centre more on the US in favour of an international point of view. I‚Äôm kind of sad that this is happening, because it excludes the remaining 96% of the world population, or 57% of reddit user activity. Generations are certainly not limited to a specific country on the American continent, and the factors that unite and define Gen Z such as relatable internet memes and apathy at the current economic situation (why houses this expensive!) do bridge across the continents.

And, as we were all\* taught, excluding other kids is no fun.

That does not mean that people can‚Äôt talk about the USA if they want to. It would however be very helpful if you wouldn‚Äôt refer to the USA as ‚Äòthis country‚Äô or ‚Äòour country‚Äô, or in general forget that the rest of the world, you know, exists.

**What is defaultism? And US-defaultism?**

Defaultism in general refers to the act of assuming that something is the case without it being explicitly introduced. US-defaultism refers to people assuming that whatever happens, happens in the US, and whoever you speak to online also lives in the US. Instances of this are forgetting that other time zones exist, that the US constitution is not universal, and correcting someone‚Äôs British English. If you need another example, the r/USdefaultism community has you covered.¬†

**But isn‚Äôt Reddit an American site?**

Yes, Reddit corporate is based in the USA. No, it isn‚Äôt an American (USA) site, because its top-level domain is .com (commercial) and not .us (united states of america). This makes it an international website, which can be seen in the various communities which don‚Äôt speak English at all. Nor are Americans (USA) the majority of the users, but the plurality, meaning that if you were to receive a random user odds are they aren‚Äôt American.

**The numbers.**

Roughly how dominant are people from the USA on Reddit? It depends how you measure this. If we look at total activity, which ignores dead accounts, we find that 42.95% of the activity is generated by people from the USA. (source below) Adding together the percentages found in that table for every European country results in a total of 35.19% of the total activity being generated by Europe.

But what about the members of r/GenZ? Well, according to this poll (reddit link below) there‚Äôs about three people from the USA for every two Europeans, though this will be old by the time I post it.

Ty for reading my little rant.

I got rid of Instagram and Snapchat (the only 2 things I've ever had) because I found myself constantly checking to see what anyone I knew was doing at anytime of the day. I pay for a phone bill, if I was actually interested in what one of my friends was doing, or wanted to vent to someone I trusted, why not just call or text them? A concerning amount of people are so obsessed to let insane amounts of people (most of which they may not even be that close with) know how their life is going. All those people who are doing really poorly and make a pathetic display of themselves online for some semblance of sympathy or attention anywhere they can get it. People who are doing really well showing off to get praise they havent been recieving. This isn't anything new, but it has definitely gotten much worse. I can genuinely say getting rid of those platforms has really helped my mental state a ton. I'm not constantly worried about being left out, missing something, or not knowing about something. Take this with a grain of salt, but if you genuinely have real friends, they will listen to you talk about your problems. If you're a genuinely real friend, your friends should feel comfortable to talk to you about their problems. When people post about these things online, I feel like it just gives up a very personal and intimate part of what makes relationships, romantic or not, work in real life. When you post something, you normally think about the people who are going to see it. Do you ever get genuinely upset, when the person you want to see it does, and doesn't like your post? Doesn't slide up on your story? Likes it but doesn't say anything? What the fuck is the point. You cannot start to feel better regarding anything without first starting to focus on yourself.

she's very religious too. the thing a lot of people call abuse is when i was around 12 or 13 my school caught me cutting myself so i was given a referral to a mental health place. i spoke to the lady there for one session and she said she suspected i had autism but my mother didn't want me diagnosed with anything so she completely pulled me from that help program and instructed me to pray and sleep with a bible under my pillow after sorta yelling at me. I know that sounds a bit bad but she's from a very religious culture which is nothing like the UK so her intent isn't to abuse me. she's just a bit difficult but aren't everyone's parents? just because she's not my best friend doesn't mean she's abusing me. she's just a bit different. It's just her way of looking out for me.

1c45o83,1713132356.0,"The decline in 3rd places and the rise of social media is only part of the story as to why many young people are hanging out less, have fewer close friends nowadays.","Hello everyone. 

So as the title says, theres been a lot of discussion lately about the decline in 3rd spaces as to the reasons why many young people nowadays have few close friends, are hanging out less etc. I would like to give a new perspective on it. 

I think there has been little attention given to the plite of people with disabilities. for my case for instance, i have been fully blind since i was 4 and a half months old, but i have tried to make the best of the situation given my circumstances. 

i am also not from the US, but i live in another anglophone country and i have traveled a good bit with my parents, and this seems to be a major issue in many anglophone countries. 

for example. i went to university, and out of a population of 15,000 students, at the time when i was in college I was the only blind person at that university. if there were other blind people there we didn‚Äôt hear about them and my parents never saw any other blind people there throughout my studies. even if there were other blind students on campus, the campus was like a literal maize. the main building was nearly impossible to get around without sighted help, most of the elevators had no braille in them, and it was a constant fight for academic supports throughout my 6 years of undergrad and post grad study. 

i got involved in clubs and societies on campus. However my experience with friendships in my courses was not a great experience. there was a lot of the time, a very ignorant almost ableist attitude towards people with disabilities from many of the people in my course. you‚Äôd be better off sticking with other disabled people for friendships were common statements that came my way when it came to a lot of college mates. 

While I did make some friends with some people in my course, most college mates went home most weekends and rarely ever hung out outside of lectures. Many had no hobbies outside of drinking and getting drunk in bars, and while I was never really into that scene because I don‚Äôt drink and just found a lot of nightclubs to be too noisy environments , I was more than willing to hangout with them in different places, Unfortunately, most weren‚Äôt interested, so I ended up making friends with mostly exchange students. 

Most of the clubs and society groups went home most weekends too. Despite that, I still got out and still do get out regularly with my parents and I have tried various activities, including swimming, bowling, rock climbing, skiing and even skateboarding. I even tried surfing too! 

While many have rightly stated that the advent of social media and smart phones might be a contributing factor to less people hanging out and going outside etc, the reality is that social media existed long before the pandemic and the internet has actually been a lifeline for people like myself. Music production has been a huge part of my life, and apart from a dj society I was part of at university it was difficult to find people with similar interests nearby. 

Things have really changed here since covid though. There‚Äôs no cafe or restaurant scene after 6 pm and most independent coffee shops are closed around here after 3 or 4 pm. There is nothing to do in the city at night nowadays apart from eat and drink in pubs. 

Also, the city has become quite unsafe at night recently, a lot more people begging on the streets and people looking for money on a regular basis from passers by and all sorts of things which is really sad to see. 

If things were not so expensive at the moment and the city not so unsafe at night I would love to see much more of a late evening cafe culture here like they have in much of continental Europe. Even though the interest might be there for it I am not sure how it would work in reality. At present the costs of running small businesses are through the roof , and there aren‚Äôt enough non drinkers to keep many cafes open passed 6 pm in the evenings. 

There are some other observations I have made as a blind person. Neighbours in the neighbourhood hardly salute each other on the streets now and hardly ever have get togethers. The city center is like a ghost town after 6 pm , and many of the local cafes, restaurants are an awful lot quieter than they use to be. There are 2 bookstores in my city, and they have become as quiet as a mouse over the last 2 years. ",2,7,1.0,GenZ
1c402jv,1713118533.0,Concerning the gen A hate,"I think it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous that we‚Äôre getting to hate Gen alpha on a generational level.

Most of gen alpha can‚Äôt even punctuate correctly at the moment, they aren‚Äôt capable of complex thought processes, discerning consequence, or understanding intricate details.

They are children with sensitive feelings working with what was given to them, they had no choice BUT to be born into a world with technology so rampant that they‚Äôve eventually come to form their own net culture just like we did. 

Everyone hates skibidy toilet but to me it‚Äôs the same as Ugandan knuckles. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs like a way louder and more obnoxious version of the surreal memes phase we had, (remember meme man everyone? Orang, vegetal, t h e v o i d)

It seems that, especially after the pandemic, a lot of people have expressed a disconnect from nature and desire to be close to it. I've seen a spike in off grid and outdoorsy/survival content online recently, as if a lot of people are feeling this way now.

I myself have felt isolated from nature for a long time; my goal is to relocate to the mountians in a few years and start up a small homestead, so I can actually spend my time outdoors and live in nature instead of treating it like a brief escape from my house. It's interesting how suddenly it seems like a lot of people also have similar desires. 

I think it speaks a lot about how modern life can deprive us of some of our most basic, human needs, like being outside and able to run, play and live under the sun instead of shingles and concrete.

 I know for one that never I find myself in that field, no matter how bad my day was or how depressed I feel, no matter all my worries, fears and troubles about the past and future of my life, I'm able to just unwind and enjoy the present; all the birds and bugs chittering around me, the wind weaving through the grasses, the feeling of the fresh dirt on my hands, it all just makes me feel, well, happy and at peace.

1c2wcaf,1712993555.0,"It is NOT too late for you. If you are depressed with 0 friends, become someone you like.","I have had 0 friends. I know people who had no friends a year ago. You gotta understand something:

No one wants to be your friend if you're always fucking negative. The negative emotions *themselves* are killing you. It's physically unhealthy to be so upset all the time, but it is fixable. You need to become a person you like being around, that's what makes other people attracted to you. Your smiles will be forced, and you will be awkward. That's because you're not good at being happy or likeable yet. Just imagine in five years, you could have so many friends that when some other poor fuck comes up to you and awkwardly tries to force a friendship that you will feel the same way toward them: pity and discomfort.

It's sad to see young people go through it. I been through it, so I know how it is. What's even worse is to be 45 with 0 friends, 0 bitches (male or female), 0 interests outside drinking/smoking your problems away, and always talking about how unfair life is.

Get your skin clear. Take care of your oral hygiene. Look at clothes and decide what style you like. Find a band or comedian you love. Get *really* good at something. Exercise and eat the right amount of food to gain/lose weight. Go (back) to school for what you want to do. Learn how to deal with anxiety as a physical symptom.

Foster competence, not confidence. Don't tell yourself you should like yourself. Make yourself that motherfucking guy.

Become who you really are.

Edit: Seems to be some confusion about the 'poor fuck' comment. I'll assume my point wasn't clear and I needed to phrase it better. The point isn't to become apathetic to other people's suffering -- it's that when you're in it you feel like the weirdo. When you got your own thing going on, you see exactly why (even if you were that weirdo before) people don't want to be around thise types of people. When you got your own thing going on, other people can tell and like to be around those kinds of people. When you're so available that they're your only friend, it forces people into an awkward situation when you need that for your social interaction, and they genuinely are just tryna live their life. If you had a good life, you're not gonna dive headfirst into someone else's problems to solve them. People want other people who are like them, they don't want friends out of pity. Sorry for the confusion.

Second edit: For half yall commenting that you have already improved everything and still have no friends: this post was for you. You lack self-awareness. You're defensive, depressive, and not fun to be around. If you don't want to be told what your problem is, you're not gonna get better.

I‚Äôve been in college and high school for the past 4 years because I‚Äôm in a program at the college that I go to that let‚Äôs you take high school and college classes at the same time for free there because they get money from the state since you are in high school technically. But that is besides the point I‚Äôm going into automotive engineering and all these classes are just draining the life out of me. Sometimes I feel like just not getting out of bed not going to school. Just one day with out worrying about when the next assignment is due or when is the next Calculus test and am I prepared. I just want to be an automotive engineer already.

Like why have I taken all of these classes and still know nothing about what I‚Äôm going into. I haven‚Äôt even taken an automotive class yet. Also after doing the same draining routine every day I go do something different and don‚Äôt enjoy it because well I could be using my time to get my work done instead and feel like I‚Äôm wasting time here and I should really do this work first. This is why I can‚Äôt be motivated to work out anymore I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about the time I‚Äôm wasting. Like I just want this constant feeling of dread and unhappiness to just end. I feel like a husk of what I used to be I used to be able to be happy, motivated, and felt like I could do anything I put my mind to. Now I constantly have a feeling of boredom, I‚Äôm so unmotivated that I have to force myself to do anything school related, and now my first question to myself when I do school work is why am I doing this how is this helping me.

So sometimes I just want to walk away go for a drive maybe because that‚Äôs the only thing I really enjoy anymore because I have to drive to go places. So it is fun being by myself in the car when it is only me and the road in front of me no noise no music just peace. Especially when drive a 4:00AM and it‚Äôs me and my car just that.

I also splurged a little money on a sports car from my weekend job and it‚Äôs the only thing I really love and when I get home I take the keys out of the ignition and just kind of sit there no phone no anything I just sit. Not even thinking just sitting. Because I know the second I leave the car all that stress all that worry comes back.

Anyways do any of you know what I should do to fix myself because I really just want to stop doing everything. I also think I might just be lonely and someone to talk to would be nice. I also am not saying I‚Äôm giving up on college that is the last thing I want to do. But I just can‚Äôt stop feeling this way.",7,1,0.67,GenZ

I currently live in France, and the age of majority is 18, in a few months soon, I would be 18, I would be officially declared as an adult for the state, it worries me, I will have to pass the permit, the baccalaureate, do graduate studies, big stuff, I once heard in a forum a sentence like ‚ÄòLittle by little the realities of the adult world will end up hitting you little by little with age‚Äô.

1c4ae8n,1713145695.0,Why do so many in Gen Z like socialism?,"What the title says.

All economic systems seek to solve the same economic problem:

The output of a country is limited, so what goods and services should be produced and how should they be distributed?

Socialism attempts to solve this problem with a central authority that determines what should be produced and where those products should go.

Leaving aside the obvious potential for corruption, this system only works as long as the central government authority remains in touch with what goods and services the people want; which often does not last for more than 3-4 generations without serious issues.

As a result, socialist countries generally have lower average standards of living than capitalist countries.

I like my little pony, animanga, fanfiction, danmei, read comics and I like to make games on roblox sometimes. My only big projects I've ever completed are roblox games, fanfiction and anime art.

A lot of people may argue that there's nothing wrong with my interests, and there wouldn't be if I only liked one of these things but combined with all of the others? It's honestly quite childish. Danmei for example is quite adult, however mixed with my other stuff ? Childish...

I had a media teacher a few months back whod just regularly pick on me after noticing I had a pony sticker on my pocket sketchbook. She'd just regularly tell me to grow up and that I'm childish in front of all of my peers and i got so anxious attending her classes that I'd almost faint a lot of the time. Tho, no matter how harsh or mean she's correct. I'm an adult now and have to drop my immature interests. Most teachers are quite chill, especially with creative subjects and she was quite nice to everyone else so clearly im the proglem.

Most Boomers are living paycheck to paycheck like the rest of us. What you see online is the reality most of them live. I mean, 70% of the world‚Äôs wealth is held by 1% of the population and a good chunk of them aren‚Äôt boomers.

Boomers lived a time of economic prosperity and took advantage of it. They were young and dumb kids who didn‚Äôt think that the economy was going to collapse.

I feel like this generational war is pointless. Yes, Boomers aren‚Äôt as knowledgeable in certain areas like we are, but there will be a time where our kids will say the same thing about us.

1c3dt9j,1713046720.0,GenZ on the workfloor,"Hi everyone,

I'm a millenial (on the edge of GenZ) and I give communication training at work to all kinds of people. I'm asking you for some advice on how to deal with the following case. Just want to mention English is not my first language and I'm really not trying to make generalizations, just looking for answers from a broader perspective.  
This month I'm training a group of managers who have a specific question about how to be a good manager to GenZ, specifically those members of GenZ who are starting their first 'real'/grown-up job. These managers are all 40+ and they have a job in which you get to become a manager by having a lot of experience in the field - so they're not educated on management much (that's where I come in) - but they have a strong expertise in their field. Anyway, something they struggle with is staying in contact with the GenZ members of their team. Common situations are when they've asked an employee several times 'Do you need help?' to which they answer no, but then in hindsight it turns out they did very much need help but never asked (even though the managers reached out several times). Because of the nature of the work people often work remotely and this makes it hard for managers help proactively, the work asks for some independence (which already shows part of the issue since that's typically not what people need in the first year of their first job).   
Other struggles are GenZ using their phones a lot during work, and even though they've been asked not to because it affects the quality of the work, still not being able to beat that addiction/put it down, struggling to show vulnerability (not asking for help, not admitting they don't know how to do something, sharing any personal issues even if relevant to the work, overestimating themselves a lot in for example performance reviews but also the tasks they ask to take on). 

Obviously we're also looking into what the managers can improve, and the policy of the company itself etc. I'm also almost part of the generation so I do have some of my own answers on the following questions, but I want to look outside of my own bubble of my circle and of scientific sources I can find on this and ask these questions to you on Reddit, so:

**My questions are:**

\- Do you, GenZ members, also experience this at work (struggling to show vulnerability, admit mistakes, overestimating yourself, not sharing personal issues relevant to the work) and if so, what causes it for you?

\- What do you need from a manager in your job? What would your ideal manager look like?

\- How would you like your workplace to deal with phone use? 

Obviously if you have anything else to add or to share, please do so! I understand it's hard to judge a situation with this little details, I'm sorry for not being able to share more. Thanks in advance!!

I‚Äôm trying to understand the doomer mindset that many adopted on this subreddit. I see a lot of posts mentioning real common problems plaguing our generation such as the economy, social isolation, mental health crisis and many more in the current state of the world. Everytime someone on this subreddit posts some pretty good advice, it get dismissed or downvoted. Part of the reason may be that the posts are usually are written in a condescending/patronizing way or think they have the magical cure to all the problems, but it goes much deeper. It seems alot of us have given up and became hopeless that their situtation wont get better even if they tried. While I agree that many of these problem do impact our lives one or another, It shouldn't keep from trying to make the best out of any situation.

I've joined a few groups online for parents, and there are thousands of teens who refuse or can't go to school mostly due to mental health issues or bullying. Are any of you Gen-Z folks able to shed some light on this? Was it a thing for you when you were in school? Did you know kids who just dropped off the face of the earth and stopped attending? What did you think of them? Did you go through a phase of not attending? Did you end up going back? What changed to help you get back to school? Is this a common topic on Tik Tok that's being spread as a thing to do if you're suffering? Why is this such a phenomenon now? Covid and home schooling? I'd appreciate any insight. Thank you.

1c2whko,1712994170.0,"We need a different way to think and talk about climate change, corporate greed, rising inequalities and new technologies like AI and biotech ","Not just as green, equality and regulation lenses to put on our societies and economies, but as an all-encompassing systemic approach, nothing less than changing the socioeconomic systems that drive our postindustrial societies and their rules. As many people discussed in frustrating length, the individual angle is overplayed.  

For such a systemic change in economics, politics, society and technology we need to influence the people at the levers. Politicians need and feel strongly that the people care, that their own success depends on tackling rapid climate change, corporate greed, rising inequalities and new technologies like AI and biotech. When governments are reluctant to change and make laws impacting their key voters, we need to vote them out and vote in people who respect science and facts. We need to hold them accountable for implementing the most effective strategies. Not waste our time with things like banning plastic straws and more tax on companies, but by moving the big levers. The top 1 percent and capitalism, marginalized communities, those affected by decarbonization, food, transportation, energy, overconsumption, mass extinction, topsoil loss, waste, construction, biotechnology and AI. Planetary boundaries like ocean acification, phosphorus and nitrogen runoff, freshwater withdrawal, land conversion, ecotoxicity and waste, topsoil loss and loss of species need to be respected.     

When industries fight against regulations and changing their ways or even being abandoned, for the fear of losses or in an honest attempt their own, we need politicians to step in and do force them. If they still don't cooperate, harsh regulations and laws need to force or bankrupt them. 

We need better laws like standards, investments, anticapitalist regulations and other regulations, we need better cities with more green spaces, denser, better housing in larger amounts, less cars and more car free transit. We need better infrastructure like nuclear and renewables, public transportation and bike lanes, adaptation infrastructure and natural spaces like forests and meadows. We need better agriculture like crop rotation, natural fertilizers, rewilding some fields and using less pesticides.

AI and biotech need regulation to prevent something like Cyberpunk or digital 1984 from happening. Privacy needs to be protected. Those impacted by future automation need something like universal basic income. 

Big companies need anti monopoly laws, bigger taxes and need to pay those unpaid. Ultimately, the need for profit needs to be removed together with capitalism.  

The Global North and companies need to pay off reparations to the Global South for decades of pollution, exploitation, slavery and destruction. The Global South needs to finally make independent decisions, not be influenced by the Global North, and be listened to by other countries. 

Subsidies for meat, fossil fuels and other harmful industries like the military need to be abandoned and funneled into renewables, nuclear, public transit and other low carbon solutions.               

Work needs to be reduced to 4 hours a day 4 days a week so you can have time for yourself, society, education and most importantly, having children.

The government needs to provide services like healthcare, education, housing, food and water, transportation, internet, energy, and ensure equality, political voice and ensure they're accessible to all citizens and that their basic needs don't impact planetary boundaries like climate change, ocean acification, phosphorus and nitrogen runoff, freshwater withdrawal, land conversion, topsoil loss, ecotoxicity and waste and loss of species.

1c37g7p,1713029967.0,I don‚Äôt like being grouped into GenZ Because they think we are all the same dumb kids who don‚Äôt know anything. All though that May be true it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve understood concepts about society when I was 8 years old When people who have been living for 50 years still don‚Äôt understand.,"

One reason why I think I should not be grouped in with all of you is because most of you believe the lie about good and bad but the truth is that Good and bad don‚Äôt exist they are just terms that humans and religion made to control us. The only true law is the law of nature. What you view as good or evil is based solely upon your own perception. What you view as evil, someone else may view as good. These concepts are purely human and cannot be observed in nature. Good and evil do not actually exist. And at a microscopic level everything is made out of particles in life and there are no good particles or bad ones they are just particles moving around. So weather you kill or steal it‚Äôs all fundamentally the same thing it‚Äôs all just particles moving around. And this goes much more deeper and it explains a lot in life and even after life.

Good and evil have changed in within time. Just 200 years ago it was morally justifiable for a 50 year old to marry a 12 year old and everyone in society at that time looked at it as ‚Äúgood‚Äù but in today‚Äôs society they say ‚ÄúOh he‚Äôs a sick bastard‚Äù it‚Äôs just whatever is wanted or unwanted in society at that time. This also disproves the existence of a god because 200 years ago everyone would say that 50 year old is going to heaven but 200 years later and if the same thing happens they will say the 50 year old is going to hell.
